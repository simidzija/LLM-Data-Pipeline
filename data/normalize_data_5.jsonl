{"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michel_Weber", "text_list": ["# Michel Weber\n\nMichel Weber (born 1963) is a Belgian philosopher. He is best known as an interpreter and advocate of the philosophy of Alfred North Whitehead, and has come to prominence as the architect and organizer of an overlapping array of international scholarly societies and publication projects devoted to Whitehead and the global relevance of process philosophy.\nWeber criticizes contemporary academic philosophy for losing touch with its early Greek roots. Philosophy has a practical mission (rooted in Socratic discourse) to restore personal and social well-being, but it cannot do this, he argues, if it renounces its traditional metaphysical obligation (rooted in pre-Socratic speculation) to understand the cosmos. Weber believes that process philosophy is uniquely qualified to fulfill this double function in the post-modern world.\nWeber was educated in Belgium and the United States. The primary languages of his publications are English and French.\n", "## Education\n\nMichel Weber studied applied economics at the Saint-Louis University, Brussels (candidat ing\u00e9nieur commercial, 1986) and philosophy at the University of Louvain (UCLouvain) in Louvain-la-Neuve (licenci\u00e9 en philosophie, 1991; docteur en philosophie, 1997). His master's thesis, written under the supervision of Jean Ladri\u00e8re, dealt with the epistemological status of the \"anthropic principle\" in cosmology in light of the concepts of teleology (or \"finality\") found in Aristotle, Thomas Aquinas, and Kant.\nFrom 1993 to 1995, he was Visiting Scholar at the Center for Process Studies of the Claremont School of Theology and at Claremont Graduate University, Claremont, California (U.S.), where he worked under the supervision of John B. Cobb Jr. and David Ray Griffin.\nIn 1997, he defended his doctoral thesis, Intuition pr\u00e9-syst\u00e9matique et intuition ontologique chez Alfred North Whitehead. Euristique du pancr\u00e9ativisme de l\u2019\u00e9poque de Harvard (Pre-systematic Intuition and Ontological Intuition According to Alfred North Whitehead: The Heuristics of Pan-creativism in the Harvard Era), written under the supervision of Marcel Crabb\u00e9.\n", "## Career\n\nFrom 1997 to 2002 he was Research Fellow at the Centre de Logique de l\u2019Institut sup\u00e9rieur de Philosophie of the UCLouvain. From 2001 to 2002 he taught philosophy at the \u00c9cole europ\u00e9enne Bruxellensis II (European Baccalaureate, Anglophone Section, 6th and 7th years). From 2002 to 2007, he was Research Fellow at the Centre for Philosophical Anthropology of the UCLouvain Higher Institute of Philosophy.\nIn 2000, Weber created, with the support of Fran\u00e7ois Beets and Paul Gochet (University of Li\u00e8ge), the Chromatiques whiteheadiennes and the Whitehead Psychology Nexus, two scholarly societies intended to federate research on different aspects, nuances, and implications of the thought of A. N. Whitehead. In 2001, he created the European William James Project with Jack Barbalet (University of Leicester), Jaime Nubiola (University of Navarra) and the late Timothy L. S. Sprigge (Emeritus Edinburgh).\nIn 2002, he created the research seminars \"Chromatiques whiteheadiennes\" with the cooperation of the \"Philosophies of Experience\" research center at the Universit\u00e9 de Nantes Department of Philosophy and the Center for the Study of Pragmatism and Analytic Philosophy at the Sorbonne (le Centre d'\u00c9tudes sur le Pragmatisme et la Philosophie Analytique or CEPPA, but renamed since as  EXeCO; Universit\u00e9 Paris 1 Panth\u00e9on Sorbonne-\u00c9cole Doctorale).\nSince 2004, he has been the Editorial Director of the series Chromatiques whiteheadiennes for the academic publisher Ontos Verlag (Frankfurt) and Editorial Co-director, along with Nicholas Rescher (Pittsburgh) and Johanna Seibt (Aarhus & Konstanz), of the Process Thought series, also with Ontos Verlag (Advisory Board: Mark Bickhard, Lehigh; Jaime Nubiola, Navarra; and Roberto Poli, Trento).\nSince 2005, he has co-edited the Chromatikon: Annuaire de la philosophie en proc\u00e8s \u2014 Yearbook of Philosophy in Process at the Presses universitaires de Louvain, first with Diane d'Epr\u00e9mesnil (UCLouvain), then with Pierfrancesco Basile (University of Bern), and now with Ronny Desmet (Vrije Universiteit Brussel).\nIn 2006, he created the Chromatiques whiteheadiennes \"Centre for Philosophical Practice,\" a non-profit organization. The center now federates the three networks mentioned above (the Chromatiques whiteheadiennes, the Whitehead Psychology Nexus, and the European William James Project) and provides an institutional base for two new activities: first, the publication of a scholarly book series appearing under the label Les \u00c9ditions Chromatika (Chromatika Editions) and, second, the opening in Brussels of Belgium's first philosophical counseling service or \"philosophical praxis.\" \nSince 2007, he has been a member of the \"Contemporary Ontological Visions\" network of the Institute for Philosophical Research of the Bulgarian Academy of Sciences. In 2008\u20139, he was Visiting Professor at the New Bulgarian University, Department of Cognitive Science and Psychology & Department of Philosophy and Sociology.\nSince 2009, Weber is also a trained hypnotherapist (Institut Milton Erickson, Brussels).\n", "## Philosophical work\n\nAs a principal source of inspiration, Weber promotes the ideas of a group of loosely associated thinkers from the early 20th century who applied evolutionary thinking to psychology, epistemology, cosmology, metaphysics, and theology, giving rise to the school of thought now known as \"process philosophy.\" Alfred North Whitehead (1861\u20131947), along with C. S. Peirce (1839\u20131914), Henri Bergson (1859\u20131941), and William James (1842\u20131910), is regarded as one of the fathers of process philosophy. This mostly Anglo-American school of thought still finds only minority endorsement in academic philosophy departments. Nevertheless, despite its limited reception in the United States and Great Britain, process philosophy has begun to interest a small but growing number of scholars worldwide. By organizing a global network of like-minded scholars and fostering the publication of their ideas in Europe, Weber has contributed significantly to the visibility of process philosophy in that continent.\nThere also appears to be a shift of focus. Until recently, interest in Whitehead, especially in the United States, tended to focus on process theology. Whitehead's brief but provocative theological speculations, added almost as an afterthought at the end of his major philosophical opus Process and Reality (1929), were elaborated into an excitingly new natural theology that seemed particularly attractive to Christian theologians because it made naturalistic sense of God's personal love for creatures. This theological emphasis, however, along with a sometimes evangelical tone adopted by Whitehead's more ardent devotees, may be the reason for the marginalization of process philosophy in mainstream academic philosophy.\nWith his 1996 book Process Metaphysics, the eminent and prolific American philosopher Nicholas Rescher began a campaign to rehabilitate a broadly secular style of process thinking. He defended it as the optimal matrix for any systematic theorizing about the nature of things. Like Rescher in the United States, Weber cultivates a critical and largely secular appreciation for process philosophy. He translated Rescher's Process Metaphysics into French in 2006.\nIn 2000, his monograph La dialectique de l\u2019intuition chez A. N. Whitehead. Sensation pure, pancr\u00e9ativit\u00e9 et onto-logisme (The Dialectic of Intuition in the Philosophy of Alfred North Whitehead: Pure Sensation, Pancreativity, and Onto-logism) was awarded a prize by the Belgian Royal Academy (Classe des Lettres de l\u2019Acad\u00e9mie Royale de Belgique). Weber argues that the term pancreativism constitutes the more appropriate qualification of Whitehead's metaphysics, which is neither a pantheism or a panentheism.\n", "## Professional activities\n\nWeber is the author of 10 monographs and 80 scholarly articles and encyclopedia entries. His monograph La Dialectique de l\u2019intuition chez A. N. Whitehead: sensation pure, pancr\u00e9ativit\u00e9 et contigu\u00efsme (The Dialectic of Intuition in the Philosophy of Alfred North Whitehead: Pure Sensation, Pancreativity, and Onto-logism) was awarded the Prix du Concours annuel 2000 by the Royal Academy of Belgium.\nHe is also the motive force behind numerous international and intercultural collaborations. He strives to coordinate his professional activities toward the creation of a new, visionary philosophical culture conceived as cooperative, intellectually adventurous, ethically self-aware, and global in reach.\n    \u2022 He has founded three international scholarly societies:\n  \n        \u2022 Chromatiques whiteheadiennes,\n        \u2022 the Whitehead Psychology Nexus, and\n        \u2022 the European William James Project.\n\n\n  \n    \u2022 He manages a non-profit publishing house,\n  \n        \u2022 \u00c9ditions Chromatika.\n\n\n  \n    \u2022 And, he oversees (in conjunction with various colleagues) the publication of four book series\n  \n        \u2022 the Chromatiques whiteheadiennes,\n        \u2022 the Ontos Verlag Series in Process Thought,\n        \u2022 the Whitehead Psychology Nexus Studies, and\n        \u2022 the Chromatika editions,\n\n    \n    as well as a philosophical annual,\n        \u2022 Chromatikon: Annuaire de la philosophie en proc\u00e8s \u2014 Yearbook of Philosophy in Process.\n\n\n\nUsing process philosophy as a matrix to foster synergies, Weber follows the work of hundreds of scholars worldwide and with each of his projects defines a locus where he thinks creative energies are poised to intersect. Collaborating with some 150 scholars representing all continents, he has to date edited or co-edited 30 collections, bringing together hundreds of original papers on themes relating to process philosophy in an interdisciplinary and multicultural context.\n    \u2022 Most ambitious in scope is the two-volume Handbook of Whiteheadian Process Thought, edited by Weber and Will Desmond: \"Gathering 115 entries written by 101 internationally renowned experts in their fields, the Handbook of Whiteheadian Process Thought aims at interpreting Whitehead secundum Whitehead, at canvassing the current state of knowledge in Whiteheadian scholarship and at identifying promising directions for future investigations through (internal) cross-elucidation and (external) interdisciplinary and crossdisciplinary development.\"\n\n    \u2022 Also noteworthy is the recent interdisciplinary volume edited by Weber and Anderson Weekes, Process Approaches to Consciousness in Psychology, Neuroscience, and Philosophy of Mind, which \"opens a dialogue between process philosophy and [the burgeoning field of] contemporary consciousness studies.\" It is too early to judge how this book will be received by those who approach the study of consciousness from more mainstream backgrounds in Anglo-American Analytic philosophy or in Continental Phenomenology and Existentialism, but the contributors to this volume make a point of establishing  what they believe to be fertile common ground between process thought and both its mainstream rivals.\n\nWeber is also the founder of the Centre for Philosophical Practice in Brussels. Philosophical Counseling is a recent movement, probably begun in the United States, employing Socratic methods of dialog for the purpose of short-term counseling that, without seeking to replace more traditional psychotherapies, nevertheless offers an alternative to them.\nIn July 2010, he  organized an Applied Process Metaphysics Summer Institute in Paris, at the Cit\u00e9 universitaire's Fondation Biermans Lap\u00f4tre. The second Institute has taken place in July 2011.\nIn May 2014, the philosophical counselling service moved to the Centre Kinos, now Tonaki, of the University of Louvain (UCLouvain) in Louvain-la-Neuve. Dr Weber is also currently Adjunct Professor, Department of Educational Foundations, University of Saskatchewan.\n", "## Bibliography (selection)\n\nAuthored monographs\n  1.

{"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Levine_(philosopher)", "text_list": ["# Joseph Levine (philosopher)\n\nJoseph Levine (born January 17, 1952) is an American philosopher at the University of Massachusetts Amherst who received his PhD from Harvard University in 1981.\nHe works on philosophy of mind and is best known for formulating the explanatory gap argument against a materialist explanation for consciousness. This has been cited as a precursor to David Chalmers's formulation of the hard problem of consciousness and as one of the main objections materialist theories in philosophy of mind must address. The idea of the explanatory gap is that an unbridgeable gap exists when trying to comprehend consciousness from the perspective of natural science, as a scientific explanation of mental states would require a reduction from a physical process to phenomenal experience. The property of mental states to be experienced from a subjective point of view (qualia) might not be reducible from the objective, i.e. outside, perspective of science. In this sense there would be a gap between the outside perspective of science and the internal perspective of phenomenal experience. Levine does not believe this gap necessitates a metaphysical conclusion; that is, he does not believe his argument refutes materialism. But he believes it poses a unique epistemic problem:\n    While I think this materialist response is right in the end, it does not suffice to put the mind-body problem to rest. Even if conceivability considerations do not establish that the mind is in fact distinct from the body, or that mental properties are metaphysically irreducible to physical properties, still they do demonstrate that we lack an explanation of the mental in terms of the physical.\nLevine is the author of popular and academic philosophy books and articles.\n", "## Personal life\n\nJoseph Levine is married to fellow philosopher Louise Antony and is the father of Bay Area musician Rachel Lark.\n"]}
{"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mind_(journal)", "text_list": ["# Mind (journal)\n\nMind (stylized as MIND) is a quarterly peer-reviewed academic journal published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the Mind Association. Having previously published exclusively philosophy in the analytic tradition, it now \"aims to take quality to be the sole criterion of publication, with no area of philosophy, no style of philosophy, and no school of philosophy excluded.\" Its institutional home is shared between the University of Oxford and University College London.  It is considered an important resource for studying  philosophy.\n", "## History and profile\n\nThe journal was established in 1876 by the Scottish philosopher Alexander Bain (University of Aberdeen) with his colleague and former student George Croom Robertson (University College London) as editor-in-chief. With the death of Robertson in 1891, George Stout took over the editorship and began a 'New Series'. Early on, the journal was dedicated to the question of whether psychology could be a legitimate natural science. In the first issue, Robertson wrote:\n    Now, if there were a journal that set itself to record all advances in psychology, and gave encouragement to special researches by its readiness to publish them, the uncertainty hanging over the subject could hardly fail to be dispelled. Either psychology would in time pass with general consent into the company of the sciences, or the hollowness of its pretensions would be plainly revealed. Nothing less, in fact, is aimed at in the publication of Mind than to procure a decision of this question as to the scientific standing of psychology.\nThroughout the 20th century, the journal was leading in the publishing of analytic philosophy. In 2015, under the auspices of its new editors-in-chief Lucy O'Brien (University College London) and Adrian William Moore (University of Oxford), it started accepting papers from all styles and schools of philosophy.\nMany famous essays have been published in Mind by such figures as Charles Darwin, J. M. E. McTaggart and Noam Chomsky. Three of the most famous, arguably, are Lewis Carroll's \"What the Tortoise Said to Achilles\" (1895), Bertrand Russell's \"On Denoting\" (1905), and Alan Turing's \"Computing Machinery and Intelligence\" (1950), in which he first proposed the Turing test.\n", "## Editors-in-chief\n\nThe following persons have been editors-in-chief:\n  \u2022 1876\u20131891: George Croom Robertson\n  \u2022 1891\u20131920: George Frederic Stout\n  \u2022 1921\u20131947: George Edward Moore\n  \u2022 1947\u20131972: Gilbert Ryle\n  \u2022 1972\u20131984: David Hamlyn\n  \u2022 1984\u20131990: Simon Blackburn\n  \u2022 1990\u20132000: Mark Sainsbury\n  \u2022 2000\u20132005: Michael Martin\n  \u2022 2005\u20132015: Thomas Baldwin\n  \u2022 2015\u2013present: Adrian William Moore and Lucy O'Brien\n", "## Notable articles\n\n### Late 19th century\n  \u2022 \"A Biographical Sketch of an Infant\" (1877) \u2013 Charles Darwin\n  \u2022 \"What is an Emotion?\" (1884) \u2013 William James\n  \u2022 \"What the Tortoise Said to Achilles\" (1895) \u2013 Lewis Carroll\n### Early 20th century\n  \u2022 \"The Refutation of Idealism\" (1903) \u2013 G.

Rorty does this by presenting them as pseudo-problems that only exist in the language-game of epistemological projects culminating in analytic philosophy.

In doing so, he builds upon the work of philosophers such as Quine, Sellars, and Donald Davidson. Rorty opts out of the traditional objective/subjective dialogue in favor of a communal version of truth. For him, \"true\" is simply an honorific that knowers bestow upon claims, asserting that they are what \"we\" want to say about a particular matter.\nRorty explains how philosophical paradigm shifts and their associated philosophical \"problems\" can be considered the result of the new metaphors, vocabularies, and mistaken linguistic associations which are necessarily a part of those new paradigms.\n", "## Reception\n\nPhilosophy and the Mirror of Nature was seen to be somewhat controversial upon its publication.

He coined the term \"nomological danglers\".\n", "## Biography\n\nThe son of a trained weaver who became a textile designer, Feigl was born in Reichenberg (Liberec), Bohemia, into a Jewish (though not religious) family. He matriculated at the University of Vienna in 1922 and studied physics and philosophy under Moritz Schlick, Hans Hahn, Hans Thirring, and Karl B\u00fchler. He became one of the members of the Vienna Circle in 1924 and would be one of the few Circle members (along with Schlick and Friedrich Waismann) to have extensive conversations with Ludwig Wittgenstein and Karl Popper. Feigl received his doctorate at Vienna in 1927 for his dissertation Zufall und Gesetz: Versuch einer naturerkenntnistheoretischen Klarung des Wahrscheinlichkeits- und Induktionsproblems (Chance and Law: An Epistemological Analysis of the Roles of Probability and Induction in the Natural Sciences). He published his first book, Theorie und Erfahrung in der Physik (Theory and Experience in Physics), in 1929. \nIn 1930, on an International Rockefeller Foundation scholarship at Harvard University, Feigl met the physicist Percy Williams Bridgman, the philosopher Willard Van Orman Quine, and the psychologist Stanley Smith Stevens, all of whom he saw as kindred spirits. In 1931, with Albert Blumberg, he published the paper \"Logical Positivism: A New European Movement\" which argued for logical positivism to be renamed \"logical empiricism\" based upon certain realist differences between contemporary philosophy of science and the older positivist movement.\nIn 1930, Feigl married Maria Kaspar and emigrated with her to the United States, settling in Iowa to take up a position in the philosophy department at the University of Iowa. Their son, Eric Otto, was born in 1933. In 1940, Herbert Feigl accepted a position as professor of philosophy at the University of Minnesota, where he remained for 31 years. His close professional and personal relationship with Wilfrid Sellars produced many different collaborative projects, including the textbook Readings in Philosophical Analysis and the journal Philosophical Studies, which he and Sellars (with other colleagues) founded in 1949.\nIn 1953, he established the Minnesota Center for Philosophy of Science (the first center of its kind in the United States) with a grant from the Hill Foundation. He was appointed Regents Professor of the University of Minnesota in 1967.\nFeigl believed that empiricism is the only adequate philosophy for experimental science. Though he became a philosopher instead of a chemist, he never lost the perspective, and the scientific commonsense, of a practical scientist. He was one of the signers of the Humanist Manifesto and he was, in the paradigmatic sense, a philosopher of science. \nFeigl retired in 1971 and died of cancer on 1 June 1988 in Minneapolis.

His contributions to philosophy include a defence of a non-physicalist account of the mind; a defence of intentionalism about consciousness; a defence of the thesis that perceptual experience has non-conceptual content; a psychologistic approach to the objects of thought; and a defence of the thesis that intentionality is the mark of the mental.

Green completed a B.A., M.A., and  B. Litt. from Oxford University. She studied psychical research at Trinity College, Cambridge from 1958 to 1960.\nFrom 1957 to 1962, Green held the post of Research Secretary at the Society for Psychical Research in London.  In 1961, Green founded and became the Director of the Institute of Psychophysical Research. The Institute's areas of interest were initially listed as philosophy, psychology, theoretical physics, and ESP. However, its principal work during the sixties and seventies concerned hallucinations and other quasi-perceptual experiences. In 1982,  while Green was the director, the Institute investigated psychokinetic phenomena.\n", "## Writing\n\nIn 1968 Green published Lucid Dreams, a study of a phenomenon described by Green as when a dreamer consciously changes the content of their dreams. The possibility of conscious insight during dreams had previously been treated with scepticism by some philosophers and psychologists and scientific skepticism continued after her book was published.\nGreen collated both previously published first-hand accounts and the results of longitudinal studies of four subjects of her own. In Lucid Dreams, she proposed a correlation between lucid dreams and the rapid eye movement (REM) stage of sleep. In 1968, Green also published a collection of 400 first-hand accounts of out-of-body experiences for the benefit of scientists interested in studying the phenomena.\nWith Charles McCreery, Green co-authored the 1975 book Apparitions and the 1994 book Lucid Dreaming: The Paradox of Consciousness During Sleep. Apparitions is a taxonomy of 'apparitions', or hallucinations in which the viewpoint of the subject was not ostensibly displaced, based on a collection of 1500 first-hand accounts. A 1976 Kirkus Reviews review of Apparitions states, \"It's hard to imagine anyone being converted by this [Institute for Psychophysical Research] product: an endless sequence of supposed apparitions [...] There are minimal efforts at objective classification by type of experience and attendant phenomena\u2014visual and auditory effects, collective apparitions, out-of-body experiences\u2014but none whatever at verification.\"\n### Aphorisms\nHer aphorisms have been published in The Decline and Fall of Science and Advice to Clever Children. Ten are included in the Penguin Dictionary of Epigrams, and three in the Penguin Dictionary of Modern Quotations.\n### CDs\nThe CD titled Lucid Dreams 0096, which includes parts of the book Lucid Dreams narrated by Green for the label Em:t, was released in 1995. Earlier Green had contributed a nine-minute track to a compilation CD put out by the same recording label.

{"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tharpa_Publications", "text_list": ["# Tharpa Publications\n\nTharpa Publications (Sanskrit for \"liberation\" and pronounced \"Tar-pa\") is a New York-based \"major international and multilingual publisher of Buddhist books.\" These include basic Buddhist meditation books such as The New Meditation Handbook, books on the Buddhist way of life such as Universal Compassion, books on Buddhist philosophy and psychology such as Heart of Wisdom, and books on Buddhist Tantra. It was founded by the Buddhist author and scholar Geshe Kelsang Gyatso. \nTharpa Publications is a non-profit corporation that has operated for 25 years and claims to have sold over a million books. Helen Waterhouse adds that the books \"are distributed widely and may be seen on the shelves of popular booksellers as well as in university libraries.\"\n", "## Kelsang Gyatso\n\nTo date, Tharpa has published 22 of his books, covering the entire range of Buddha Shakyamuni's Sutra and Tantra teachings. According to its website, \"Tharpa publishes the works of Geshe Kelsang Gyatso, a contemporary Buddhist master who presents the essential practices of Buddhism in a way that is easy to understand and practice in modern everyday life.\" Biography Research Guide describes Kelsang Gyatso's books:\n    A Tibetan Buddhist monk and scholar; Geshe Kelsang has written twenty books that aim to provide Western Dharma practitioners with essential Buddhist texts; some are books for beginners such as Transform Your Life and How to Solve Our Human Problems, books about the Mahayana path like Universal Compassion (Lojong), and books on Vajrayana (Tantra) like Mahamudra Tantra; (born 1931, in Tibet).\nA number of Kelsang Gyatso's textbooks have received favorable reviews. Bluck writes that \"The three most popular works\u2014Introduction to Buddhism, The New Meditation Handbook and Transform Your Life\u2014have sold 165,000 copies between them, showing their appeal far beyond the movement itself.\" Batchelor says that Kelsang Gyatso's books are written with \"considerable clarity.\" Braizer echoes this sentiment, saying that Kelsang  writes \"excellent\" books that are \"an important contribution to Western understanding of Buddhism and its traditions. They can stand on their own merit.\" Guide to Dakini Land and Essence of Vajrayana have been described as \"the most detailed and revealing commentary on specific tantric practices yet to be published in a Western language.\" In his book review of Guide to Dakini Land, Richard Guard said:\n    It is remarkable that the author has managed to give us so much information in only a few hundred pages. The editors are to be commended for their skilful efforts in conveying Geshe Kelsang\u2019s instructions in such simple and precise language... By making this book available for Vajrayogini practitioners, Geshe Kelsang has truly brought a blessing into our lives.\nThe books are also highly thought of within the Tibetan establishment. Three of his published works contained forewords by previous Ganden Tripas and the Dalai Lama. The Dalai Lama contributed a foreword to Buddhism in the Tibetan Tradition, while Trijang Rinpoche and Ling Rinpoche (who each held the position of Ganden Tripa) also provided forewords for his books Meaningful to Behold (which was dedicated to the long life of the Dalai Lama) and Clear Light of Bliss (which was dedicated to the late Trijang Rinpoche), respectively. Kyabje Ling Rinpoche refers to Kelsang Gyatso as \"this most precious Spiritual Guide,\" while Kyabje Trijang Rinpoche refers to him as \"The excellent expounder, the great Spiritual Master Kelsang Gyatso.\" Tsem Tulku praised Kelsang Gyatso and his publications: \"The great master, the Kadampa Geshe, Kelsang Gyatso, you can see very clearly his works, his centers, his books, his pure vows, and how many thousands of people he affects.\"\n", "## New Kadampa Tradition\n\nTharpa Publications is part of the New Kadampa Tradition - International Kadampa Buddhist Union, which is an international Buddhist charity set up for building Buddhist temples for world peace in every major city of the world. It was established in 1985 in Ulverston, UK and now has affiliates in countries throughout the world.\n### Je Tsongkhapa\nTharpa Publications is devoted to the preservation of the tradition of Je Tsongkhapa:\n    We are studying and practicing Lama Tsongkhapa's teachings and taking as our example what the ancient Kadampa Lamas and Geshes did. All the books that I have written are commentaries to Lama Tsongkhapa's teachings. We try our best to follow the example of the ancient Kadampa tradition and use the name Kadampa to remind people to practice purely.\nFor example, Joyful Path of Good Fortune is based on Je Tsongkhapa's Lamrim Chenmo (Great Exposition of the Stages of the Path to Enlightenment). Other examples include:\n  \u2022 Universal Compassion is based on Je Tsongkhapa's Sunrays of Training the Mind\n  \u2022 Understanding the Mind is based on Je Tsongkhapa\u2019s teachings on Commentary to Valid Cognition by Dharmakirti\n  \u2022 Guide to Dakini Land and Essence of Vajrayana are based on Be d\u00f6n kun s\u00e4l (Illuminating All Hidden Meanings) and Je Tsongkhapa's commentary to the Heruka sadhana, D\u00f6 jo (Wishfulfilling)\n  \u2022 Clear Light of Bliss is based on Lamp Thoroughly Illuminating the Five Stages\n  \u2022 Tantric Grounds and Paths is based on Great Exposition of the Stages of Secret Mantra\n  \u2022 Ocean of Nectar is based on Clear Illumination of the Intention: An Extensive Explanation of the Great Treatise \u2018Guide to the Middle Way\u2019.\n  \u2022 The New Meditation Handbook and Joyful Path of Good Fortune are based on Je Tsongkhapa's commentaries to Atisha's Lamrim teachings.\n### Preserving the Gelugpa tradition\nThe teachings in Tharpa's books are also in the Gelugpa lineage of Pabongka Rinpoche and Trijang Rinpoche's teachings. For example, Joyful Path of Good Fortune is a modern equivalent of Liberation in the Palm of Your Hand, written by Je Phabongkhapa and edited by Trijang Rinpoche; and The New Meditation Handbook is a concise rendition of these teachings. In the preface of Joyful Path the author writes: \n    I have received these teachings from my Spiritual Guide, Trijang Dorjechang, who was an emanation of Atisha; thus the explanations given in this book, Joyful Path of Good Fortune, actually come from him and not from myself.\nWaterhouse notes that \"All pictorial material produced by the NKT is carefully controlled to maintain the accuracy in the smallest detail\":\n    A Bath printer responsible for the production of some of the NKT's most recent publications, told me that the movement's representatives had been so particular about the reproduction of some of the illustrations in Geshe Kelsang Gyatso's Guide to Dakini Land, that the whole print run had to be repeated because a moon symbol had been omitted from one of the diagrams.\n### Use of Tharpa's books on Buddhist study programs worldwide\nFourteen of Tharpa Publications classic textbooks are used as the basis of the New Kadampa Tradition's Foundation Program and Teacher Training Program, which have tens of thousands of Buddhist students worldwide. The Foundation Program is described by Steven Heine in Buddhism in the Modern World: Adaptations of an Ancient Tradition:\n    The Foundation Program is meant for serious students who want a guided study at a deeper level than they can get through the series of Lamrim talks, usually all pitched to a beginner's capacity, that normally constitute the fare of Western Dharma centers.\nThe New Kadampa Tradition's Teacher Training Program is a rigorous \"multilayered educational\" study program of Buddha's teachings of Sutra and Tantra presented in accordance with the tradition of the Tibetan master Je Tsongkhapa (AD 1357-1419), designed for those training as Buddhist teachers.\n", "## Finances\n\nLosing money each year from 1985 onward, Tharpa Publications \"broke even\" for the first time in 1996. Tharpa Publications claims that, since that time, the author has donated all royalties from Tharpa's books to non-profit organizations that promote Buddhism. Firstly he gave these to Manjushri Institute:\n    Tharpa Publications publishes my books. They are financially independent from me and from all my Dharma Centers around the world. From the very beginning I have given Manjushri Buddhist Centre the royalties to which I am entitled as author. I have never used even one penny from this money.\nNow Tharpa says that the author donates all royalties to the International Temples' Fund. Each book also contains the information: \"Profits received by Tharpa Publications from the sale of this book will be donated to the NKT-International Temples Project\" which is \"a Buddhist Charity, Building for World Peace.\"\n", "## Publications\n\nThe books by Kelsang Gyatso in the order they were published:\n  \u2022 Meaningful to Behold: The Bodhisattva's Way of Life, Tharpa Publications (5th. ed., 2008) ISBN\u00a0978-1-906665-11-1\n  \u2022 Clear Light of Bliss: Tantric Meditation Manual, Tharpa Publications (2nd. ed., 1992) ISBN\u00a0978-0-948006-21-0\n  \u2022 Heart of Wisdom: An Explanation of the Heart Sutra, Tharpa Publications (4th. ed., 2001) ISBN\u00a0978-0-948006-77-7\n  \u2022 Universal Compassion: Inspiring Solutions for Difficult Times, Tharpa Publications (4th. ed., 2002) ISBN\u00a0978-0-948006-72-2\n  \u2022 The New Meditation Handbook: Meditations to Make Our Life Happy and Meaningful, Tharpa Publications (2003) ISBN\u00a0978-0-9817277-1-4\n  \u2022 Joyful Path of Good Fortune: The Complete Buddhist Path to Enlightenment, Tharpa Publications (2nd. ed., 1995) ISBN\u00a0978-0-948006-46-3\n  \u2022 Guide to Dakini Land: The Highest Yoga Tantra Practice of Buddha Vajrayogini, Tharpa Publications (2nd. ed., 1996) ISBN\u00a0978-0-948006-39-5\n  \u2022 The Bodhisattva Vow: A Practical Guide to Helping Others, Tharpa Publications (2nd. ed., 1995) ISBN\u00a0978-0-948006-50-0\n  \u2022 Heart Jewel: The Essential Practices of Kadampa Buddhism, Tharpa Publications (2nd. ed., 1997) ISBN\u00a0978-0-948006-56-2\n  \u2022 Great Treasury of Merit: How to Rely Upon a Spiritual Guide, Tharpa Publications (1992) ISBN\u00a0978-0-948006-22-7\n  \u2022 Introduction to Buddhism: An Explanation of the Buddhist Way of Life, Tharpa Publications (2nd. ed., 2001, US ed. 2008) ISBN\u00a0978-0-9789067-7-1\n  \u2022 Understanding the Mind: The Nature and Power of the Mind, Tharpa Publications (2nd. ed., 1997) ISBN\u00a0978-0-948006-78-4\n  \u2022 Tantric Grounds and Paths: How to Enter, Progress on, and Complete the Vajrayana Path, Tharpa Publications (1994) ISBN\u00a0978-0-948006-33-3\n  \u2022 Ocean of Nectar: The True Nature of All Things, Tharpa Publications (1995) ISBN\u00a0978-0-948006-23-4\n  \u2022 Essence of Vajrayana: The Highest Yoga Tantra Practice of Heruka Body Mandala, Tharpa Publications (1997) ISBN\u00a0978-0-948006-48-7\n  \u2022 Living Meaningfully, Dying Joyfully: The Profound Practice of Transference of Consciousness, Tharpa Publications (1999) ISBN\u00a0978-0-948006-63-0\n  \u2022 Eight Steps to Happiness: The Buddhist Way of Loving Kindness, Tharpa Publications (2000) ISBN\u00a0978-0-9817277-8-3\n  \u2022 Transform Your Life: A Blissful Journey, Tharpa Publications (2001, US ed. 2007) ISBN\u00a0978-0-9789067-4-0\n  \u2022 How to Solve Our Human Problems: The Four Noble Truths, Tharpa Publications (2005, US ed., 2007) ISBN\u00a0978-0-9789067-1-9\n  \u2022 Mahamudra Tantra: The Supreme Heart Jewel Nectar, Tharpa Publications (2005) ISBN\u00a0978-0-948006-93-7\n  \u2022 Guide to the Bodhisattva's Way of Life: How to Enjoy a Life of Great Meaning and Altruism, a translation of Shantideva's Bodhisattvacharyavatara with Neil Elliott, Tharpa Publications (2002) ISBN\u00a0978-0-948006-88-3\nTharpa Publications was originally a general Buddhist publishing house, also releasing the following works by other authors:\n  \u2022 The Eternal Legacy: An Introduction to the Canonical Literature of Buddhism, Tharpa Publications (1985) by Sangharakshita, ISBN\u00a00-948006-02-1.\n  \u2022 A Survey of Buddhism: Its Doctrines and Methods through the Ages, Tharpa Publications (1987) by Sangharakshita, ISBN\u00a00-948006-01-3   .\n  \u2022 Treasury of Dharma: A Tibetan Buddhist Meditation Course, Tharpa Publications (1988) by Geshe Rabten, ISBN\u00a00-948006-04-8.\nIn addition to publishing books, Tharpa also supplies audio books, Buddhist art, and sadhanas for prayer and meditation.\nThe 'half-drop' repeat patterns used in some NKT-IKBU artwork as well as sadhana covers, such as the peony-style flower and emblem of Manjushri (a sword and book upon a lotus) were designed by Robert Beer.\n", "## Tharpa affiliates\n\nTharpa Publications also has affiliates (which are independent companies) in Brazil, the USA, Spain, Mexico, France, Canada, Australia, Hong Kong and South Africa.\n", "## Translations\n\nTharpa books have been translated into a number of European and Asian languages.\n"]}
{"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mill%27s_Methods", "text_list": ["# Mill's Methods\n\nMill's Methods are five methods of induction described by philosopher John Stuart Mill in his 1843 book A System of Logic. They are intended to establish a causal relationship between two or more groups of data, analyzing their respective differences and similarities.\n", "## The methods\n\n### Direct method of agreement\n    If two or more instances of the phenomenon under investigation have only one circumstance in common, the circumstance in which alone all the instances agree, is the cause (or effect) of the given phenomenon. \u2014\u200aJohn Stuart Mill, Mill, John Stuart (1843). A System of Logic, Vol. 1. John W. Parker. p.\u00a0454.\nFor a property to be a necessary condition it must always be present if the effect is present. Since this is so, then we are interested in looking at cases where the effect is present and taking note of which properties, among those considered to be 'possible necessary conditions' are present and which are absent. Obviously, any properties which are absent when the effect is present cannot be necessary conditions for the effect. This method is also referred to more generally within comparative politics as the most different systems design.\nSymbolically, the method of agreement can be represented as:\n  A B C D occur together with w x y z\n  A E F G occur together with w t u v\n  \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  Therefore A is the cause, or the effect, of w.\nTo further illustrate this concept, consider two structurally different countries. Country A is a former colony, has a centre-left government, and has a federal system with two levels of government. Country B has never been a colony, has a centre-left government and is a unitary state. One factor that both countries have in common, the dependent variable in this case, is that they have a system of universal health care. Comparing the factors known about the countries above, a comparative political scientist would conclude that the government sitting on the centre-left of the spectrum would be the independent variable which causes a system of universal health care, since it is the only one of the factors examined which holds constant between the two countries, and the theoretical backing for that relationship is sound; social democratic (centre-left) policies often include universal health care.\n### Method of difference\n    \n    If an instance in which the phenomenon under investigation occurs, and an instance in which it does not occur, have every circumstance save one in common, that one occurring only in the former; the circumstance in which alone the two instances differ, is the effect, or cause, or an indispensable part of the cause, of the phenomenon. \u2014\u200aJohn Stuart Mill, Mill, John Stuart (1843). A System of Logic, Vol. 1. John W. Parker. p.\u00a0455.\nThis method is also known more generally as the most similar systems design within comparative politics.\n  A B C D occur together with w x y z\n  B C D occur together with x y z\n  \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  Therefore A is the cause, or the effect, or a part of the cause of w.\nAs an example of the method of difference, consider two similar countries. Country A has a centre-right government, a unitary system and was a former colony. Country B has a centre-right government, a unitary system but was never a colony. The difference between the countries is that Country A readily supports anti-colonial initiatives, whereas Country B does not. The method of difference would identify the independent variable to be the status of each country as a former colony or not, with the dependant variable being supportive for anti-colonial initiatives. This is because, out of the two similar countries compared, the difference between the two is whether or not they were formerly a colony. This then explains the difference on the values of the dependent variable, with the former colony being more likely to support decolonization than the country with no history of being a colony.\n### Indirect method of difference\n    If two or more instances in which the phenomenon occurs have only one circumstance in common, while two or more instances in which it does not occur have nothing in common save the absence of that circumstance; the circumstance in which alone the two sets of instances differ, is the effect, or cause, or a necessary part of the cause, of the phenomenon. \u2014\u200aJohn Stuart Mill, Mill, John Stuart (1843). A System of Logic, Vol. 1. John W. Parker. p.\u00a0463.\nAlso called the \"Joint Method of Agreement and Difference\", this principle is a combination of two methods of agreement. Despite the name, it is weaker than the direct method of difference and does not include it.\nSymbolically, the Joint method of agreement and difference can be represented as:\n  A B C occur together with x y z\n  A D E occur together with x v w\n  F G occur with y w\n  \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  Therefore A is the cause, or the effect, or a part of the cause of x.\n### Method of residue\n    Subduct from any phenomenon such part as is known by previous inductions to be the effect of certain antecedents, and the residue of the phenomenon is the effect of the remaining antecedents. \u2014\u200aJohn Stuart Mill, Mill, John Stuart (1843). A System of Logic, Vol. 1. John W. Parker. p.\u00a0465.\nIf a range of factors are believed to cause a range of phenomena, and we have matched all the factors, except one, with all the phenomena, except one, then the remaining phenomenon can be attributed to the remaining factor.\nSymbolically, the Method of Residue can be represented as:\n  A B C occur together with x y z\n  B is known to be the cause of y\n  C is known to be the cause of z\n  \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  Therefore A is the cause or effect of x.\n### Method of concomitant variations\n    Whatever phenomenon varies in any manner whenever another phenomenon varies in some particular manner, is either a cause or an effect of that phenomenon, or is connected with it through some fact of causation. \u2014\u200aJohn Stuart Mill, Mill, John Stuart (1843). A System of Logic, Vol. 1. John W. Parker. p.\u00a0470.\nIf across a range of circumstances leading to a phenomenon, some property of the phenomenon varies in tandem with some factor existing in the circumstances, then the phenomenon can be associated with that factor. For instance, suppose that various samples of water, each containing both salt and lead, were found to be toxic. If the level of toxicity varied in tandem with the level of lead, one could attribute the toxicity to the presence of lead.\nSymbolically, the method of concomitant variation can be represented as (with \u00b1 representing a shift):\n  A B C occur together with x y z\n  A\u00b1 B C results in x\u00b1 y z.\n  \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  Therefore A and x are causally connected\nUnlike the preceding four inductive methods, the method of concomitant variation doesn't involve the elimination of any circumstance.

{"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Construct_(philosophy)", "text_list": ["# Construct (philosophy)\n\nIn philosophy, a construct is an object which is ideal, that is, an object of the mind or of thought, meaning that its existence may be said to depend upon a subject's mind. This contrasts with any possibly mind-independent objects, the existence of which purportedly does not depend on the existence of a conscious observing subject. Thus, the distinction between these two terms may be compared to that between phenomenon and noumenon in other philosophical contexts and to many of the typical definitions of the terms realism and idealism also. In the correspondence theory of truth, ideas, such as constructs, are to be judged and checked according to how well they correspond with their referents, often conceived as part of a mind-independent reality.\n", "## Overview\n\nAs mind-dependent objects, concepts that are typically viewed as constructs include the abstract objects designated by such symbols as 3 or 4, or words such as liberty or cold as they are seen as a result of induction or abstraction that can be later applied to observable objects or compared to other constructs. Therefore, scientific hypotheses and theories (e.g. evolutionary theory, gravitational theory), as well as classifications (for example, in biological taxonomy), are also conceptual entities often considered to be constructs in the aforementioned sense. In contrast, most everyday, concrete things that surround the observer can be classified as objective (in the sense of being \"real,\" that is, believed to be existing externally to the observer).\nHow much of what the observer perceives is objective is controversial, so the exact definition of constructs varies greatly across different views and philosophies. The view that the senses capture most or all of the properties of external objects directly is usually associated with the term direct realism. Many forms of nominalism ascribe the process of conceptual construction to language itself, for instance, constructing the idea of \"fishness\" by drawing distinctions between the word \"fish\" and other words (such as \"rock\") or through some kind of resemblance between the referents that the class implied by the word encompasses. Conversely, Platonic idealism generally maintains that a \"reality\" independent of the subject exists, though this reality is seen as ideal, not physical or material, and so it cannot be known by the senses. As such, the idea of \"liberty\" or \"coldness\" is just as real as that of \"rockness\" or \"fishness.\"\nThe creation of constructs is a part of operationalization, especially the creation of theoretical definitions. The usefulness of one conceptualization over another depends largely on construct validity. To address the non-observability of constructs, U.S. federal agencies such as the National Institutes of Health and the National Cancer Institute have created a construct database termed Grid-Enabled Measures (GEM) to improve construct use and reuse.\nIn the philosophy of science, particularly in reference to scientific theories, a hypothetical construct is an explanatory variable which is not directly observable. For example, the concepts of intelligence and motivation are used to explain phenomena in psychology, but neither is directly observable. A hypothetical construct differs from an intervening variable in that it has properties and implications which have not been demonstrated in empirical research. These serve as a guide to further research. An intervening variable, on the other hand, is a summary of observed empirical findings.\n", "## History\n\nCronbach and Meehl (1955) define a hypothetical construct as a concept for which there is not a single observable referent, which cannot be directly observed, and for which there exist multiple referents, but none all-inclusive. For example, according to Cronbach and Meehl a fish is not a hypothetical construct because, despite variation in species and varieties of fish, there is an agreed upon definition for a fish with specific characteristics that distinguish a fish from a bird. Furthermore, a fish can be directly observed. On the other hand, a hypothetical construct has no single referent; rather, hypothetical constructs consist of groups of functionally related behaviors, attitudes, processes, and experiences. Instead of seeing intelligence, love, or fear we see indicators or manifestations of what we have agreed to call intelligence, love, or fear.\nMcCorquodale and Meehl (1948) discussed the distinction between what they called intervening variables and these hypothetical constructs. They describe hypothetical constructs as containing surplus meaning, as they imply more than just the operations by which they are measured.\nIn the positivist tradition, Boring (1923) described intelligence as whatever the intelligence test measures.  As a reaction to such operational definitions, Cronbach and Meehl (1955) emphasized the necessity of viewing constructs like intelligence as hypothetical constructs. They asserted that there is no adequate criterion for the operational definition of constructs like abilities and personality. Thus, according to Cronbach and Meehl (1955), a useful construct of intelligence or personality should imply more than simply test scores. Instead, these constructs should predict a wide range of behaviors.\n"]}
{"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_function", "text_list": ["# Correlation function\n\nA correlation function is a function  that gives the statistical correlation between random variables, contingent on the spatial or temporal distance between those variables. If one considers the correlation function between random variables representing the same quantity measured at two different points, then this is often referred to as an autocorrelation function, which is made up of autocorrelations. Correlation functions of different random variables are sometimes called cross-correlation functions to emphasize that different variables are being considered and because they are made up of cross-correlations.\nCorrelation functions are a useful indicator of dependencies as a function of distance in time or space, and they can be used to assess the distance required between sample points for the values to be effectively uncorrelated. In addition, they can form the basis of rules for interpolating values at points for which there are no observations.\nCorrelation functions used in astronomy, financial analysis, econometrics, and statistical mechanics differ only in the particular stochastic processes they are applied to.  In quantum field theory there are correlation functions over quantum distributions.\n", "## Definition\n\nFor possibly distinct random variables X(s) and Y(t) at different points s and t  of some space, the correlation function is\n$C(s,t)=\\operatorname {corr} (X(s),Y(t)),$ \nwhere $\\operatorname {corr}$  is described in the article on correlation. In this definition, it has been assumed that the stochastic variables are scalar-valued. If they are not, then more complicated correlation functions can be defined. For example, if X(s) is a random vector with n elements and Y(t) is a vector with q elements, then an n\u00d7q matrix of correlation functions is defined with $i,j$  element\n$C_{ij}(s,t)=\\operatorname {corr} (X_{i}(s),Y_{j}(t)).$ \nWhen n=q, sometimes the trace of this matrix is focused on. If the probability distributions have any target space symmetries, i.e. symmetries in the value space of the stochastic variable (also called internal symmetries), then the correlation matrix will have induced symmetries. Similarly, if there are symmetries of the space (or time) domain in which the random variables exist (also called spacetime symmetries), then the correlation function will have corresponding space or time symmetries. Examples of important spacetime symmetries are \u2014\n  \u2022 translational symmetry yields C(s,s') = C(s\u00a0\u2212\u00a0s') where s and s' are to be interpreted as vectors giving coordinates of the points\n  \u2022 rotational symmetry in addition to the above gives C(s, s') = C(|s\u00a0\u2212\u00a0s'|) where |x| denotes the norm of the vector x (for actual rotations this is the Euclidean or 2-norm).\nHigher order correlation functions are often defined. A typical correlation function of order n is (the angle brackets represent the expectation value)\n$C_{i_{1}i_{2}\\cdots i_{n}}(s_{1},s_{2},\\cdots ,s_{n})=\\langle X_{i_{1}}(s_{1})X_{i_{2}}(s_{2})\\cdots X_{i_{n}}(s_{n})\\rangle .$ \nIf the random vector has only one component variable, then the indices $i,j$  are redundant. If there are symmetries, then the correlation function can be broken up into irreducible representations of the symmetries \u2014 both internal and spacetime.\n", "## Properties of probability distributions\n\nWith these definitions, the study of correlation functions is similar to the study of probability distributions. Many stochastic processes can be completely characterized by their correlation functions; the most notable example is the class of Gaussian processes.\nProbability distributions defined on a finite number of points can always be normalized, but when these are defined over continuous spaces, then extra care is called for. The study of such distributions started with the study of random walks and led to the notion of the It\u014d calculus.\nThe Feynman path integral in Euclidean space generalizes this to other problems of interest to statistical mechanics. Any probability distribution which obeys a condition on correlation functions called reflection positivity leads to a local quantum field theory after Wick rotation to Minkowski spacetime (see Osterwalder-Schrader axioms). The operation of renormalization is a specified set of mappings from the space of probability distributions to itself. A quantum field theory is called renormalizable if this mapping has a fixed point which gives a quantum field theory.\n"]}
{"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creative_synthesis", "text_list": ["# Creative synthesis\n\nThe principle of creative synthesis was first mentioned by Wilhelm Wundt in 1862. He wanted to identify the different elements of consciousness and to see what laws govern the connections of these different elements. It started with the fact that colors, touches, and the spoken were not seen as the decoding of stimuli or the reception and storage of the things that are received into the brain from the external world. Wundt believed that instead, these factors are seen as the brain's subjective reactions to external stimuli that enter into our sensory systems. This is the concept of creative synthesis.\nThis theory shifted towards the emphasis on principles concerned with emotion, motivation, and volition as it had matured. These three ideas compete with one another, with the idea of creative synthesis at the center. This relates to the fact that Wundt viewed the mind as \"active, creative, dynamic, and volitional.\" Volitional acts are creative but they are not free. This viewpoint could be assumed due to Wundt's deterministic view. Behind every volitional action that occurs, there were mental laws that acted on the contents of the consciousness. The shift in the goal-directed activity may have occurred, but it was already determined to change from the original plan.\nThe sensory organs can be described endlessly in physics and other sciences, but these descriptions do not include explanations of the psychological qualities that are experienced. Qualities such as \"sweet\", \"heavy\", \"painful\" or \"dark blue\" are ones that can only be studied in a brain that is still able to react to experiences around it.\n\n    \n    There are no psychological qualities in physics. For example, there is no red, or green, or blue in that world. Redness, greenness, and blueness are phenomena that are created by the cortex of the experiencing individual. A musical quality, the flavor or the wine, or the familiarity of a face is a rapid creative synthesis that cannot, in principle, be explained as a mere sum of elemental physical features.\n    \n\n\nA key feature of creative synthesis is that mental capacities are more than the sum of their parts. In all psychical combinations, the product is more than the sum of their different parts that are combined; what occurs is a new creation altogether. By this, it is meant that they are generative (creative) in every aspect.  There is a real novelty and creativity in higher cognitive operations.\n", "## Two-stage process for consciousness\n\nThere is a two-stage process for consciousness. The first is a large-capacity short-term memory, which was sometimes referred to as the Blickfield. The second is a narrow-capacity focus of selection attention, or apperception, under voluntary control. The second moves through the first. Wundt's main difference between his position and that of empiricists was that he emphasized the role of attention. When someone pays attention to elements, these elements can be arranged and rearranged according to that person's will. This is how things that have not actually been experienced, can result in the brain as if they had. Wundt believed that creative synthesis was entwined with all acts of apperception. It was believed by Wundt that this apperceptive process was important for normal cognitive functioning.\nThe creative synthesis principle was continually being expanded  Factors regarding this are:\n  1. Mental states are dependent on the context in which they occur\n  2. They usually take the path of least resistance in their constructive acts\n  3. They fluctuate through opponent processes \u2013 this is called the principle of contrasts\n", "## The principle of contrasts\n\nThe principle of contrasts is the idea that opposite experiences intensify one another. For example, a pleasant experience always seems more pleasant if it follows one that is interpreted as painful. A theory that is somewhat similar to this is the principle toward the development of opposites. This is the phenomena that occurs after a prolonged experience of one type, there becomes an increasing tendency to seek out the opposite experience\nA major manifestation of creative synthesis is the concept of heterogony of ends. Heterogony of ends is the development of new motives during the series of events. There is an exchange of motives in our immediate experience and it defines the social behaviors that are engaged in as well as, the cognitive reaction to the world that occurs. An example of this would be going to the store with the intention of buying food and to come home to make dinner. But after getting to the store, you run into a friend that you have not seen in a long time, who you have missed.  This adds a new set of motives to the pre-existing or original motives.  There is almost always something that happens that changes a person's entire motivational pattern.\n"]}
{"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_contextualism", "text_list": ["# Functional contextualism\n\nFunctional contextualism is a modern philosophy of science rooted in philosophical pragmatism and contextualism. It is most actively developed in behavioral science in general and the field of behavior analysis and contextual behavioral science in particular (see the entry for the Association for Contextual Behavioral Science). Functional contextualism serves as the basis of a theory of language known as relational frame theory and its most prominent application, acceptance and commitment therapy. It is an extension and contextualistic interpretation of B.F. Skinner's radical behaviorism first delineated by Steven C. Hayes which emphasizes the importance of predicting and influencing psychological events (including thoughts, feelings, and behaviors) with precision, scope, and depth, by focusing on manipulable variables in their context.\n", "## Contextualism\n\nThe form of contextualism from which functional contextualism emerged is the one described by the philosopher Stephen C. Pepper in his book World Hypotheses: A Study in Evidence. In this work, Pepper noted that philosophical systems tend to cluster around a few distinct \"world hypotheses\" or \"world views\". Each world view is characterized by a distinctive underlying root metaphor and truth criterion. Root metaphors are based on seemingly well-understood, common-sense, everyday objects or ideas, and serve as the basic analogy by which an analyst attempts to understand the world. A world view's root metaphor roughly corresponds to its ontological assumptions, or views about the nature of being or existence (e.g., whether the universe is deterministic or not). Truth criteria are inextricably linked to their root metaphors, and provide the basis for evaluating the validity of analyses. A world view's truth criterion roughly corresponds to its epistemological assumptions, or views about the nature of knowledge and truth (e.g., whether it is discovered or constructed).\nThe root metaphor of contextualism is the \"act in context\", whereby any event is interpreted as an ongoing act inseparable from its current and historical context. The truth criterion of contextualism is often dubbed \"successful working\", whereby the truth and meaning of an idea lies in its function or utility, not in how well it is said to mirror reality. In contextualism, an analysis is said to be true or valid insofar it as it leads to effective action, or achievement of some goal. Contextualism is Pepper's term for the philosophical pragmatism developed by Charles Sanders Peirce, William James, John Dewey, and others.\n", "## Varieties of contextualism\n\nAnalytic goals are vitally important to the contextualistic world view. This is because the analytic tools of contextualism\u2014its root metaphor and truth criterion\u2014both hinge on the purpose of the analysis, and neither can be mounted effectively without a clearly specified analytic goal. The pragmatic truth criterion of \"successful working\" is rendered meaningless in an analysis without an explicit goal because \"success\" can only be measured in relation to the achievement of some objective.\nLikewise, the root metaphor of the \"act-in-context\" is rendered meaningless in an analysis without an explicit goal because there would be no basis on which to restrict the analysis to a subset of the infinite expanse of the act's historical and environmental context. Without a clear analytic goal, the contextualist could analyze the endless context of an act in perpetuity, without ever knowing when the analysis was complete or good enough to be deemed \"true\" or \"useful\". It is very difficult for a contextualist without an explicit goal to construct or share knowledge.\nContextualists can, and do, adopt different analytic goals, and the many different varieties of contextualism can be distinguished by their goals. Based on their overarching analytic goals, contextualistic theories can be divided into two general categories: \"descriptive contextualism\" and \"functional contextualism\".\n### Descriptive contextualism\nDescriptive contextualists seek to understand the complexity and richness of a whole event through a personal and aesthetic appreciation of its participants and features. This approach reveals a strong adherence to the root metaphor of contextualism and can be likened to the enterprise of history, in which stories of the past are constructed in an attempt to understand whole events. The knowledge constructed by the descriptive contextualist is personal, ephemeral, specific, and spatiotemporally restricted. Like a historical narrative, it is knowledge that reflects an in-depth personal understanding of a particular event that occurred (or is occurring) at a particular time and place. Most forms of contextualism, including social constructionism, dramaturgy, hermeneutics, and narrative approaches, are instances of descriptive contextualism.\n### Functional contextualism\nFunctional contextualists, on the other hand, seek to predict and influence events using empirically based concepts and rules. This approach reveals a strong adherence to contextualism's extremely practical truth criterion and can be likened to the enterprise of science or engineering, in which general rules and principles are used to predict and control events. Rules or theories that do not contribute to the achievement of one's practical goals are ignored or rejected. Knowledge constructed by the functional contextualist is general, abstract, and spatiotemporally unrestricted. Like a scientific principle, it is knowledge that is likely to be applicable to all (or many) similar such events, regardless of time or place.\n"]}
{"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alternative_hypothesis", "text_list": ["# Alternative hypothesis\n\nIn statistical hypothesis testing, the alternative hypothesis is one of the proposed proposition in the hypothesis test. In general the goal of hypothesis test is to demonstrate that in the given condition, there is sufficient evidence supporting the credibility of alternative hypothesis instead of the exclusive proposition in the test (null hypothesis). It is usually consistent with the research hypothesis because it is constructed from literature review, previous studies, etc. However, the research hypothesis is sometimes consistent with the null hypothesis.\nIn statistics, alternative hypothesis is often denoted as Ha or H1. Hypotheses are formulated to compare in a statistical hypothesis test.\nIn the domain of inferential statistics, two rival hypotheses can be compared by explanatory power and predictive power.\n", "## Basic definition\n\nThe alternative hypothesis  and null hypothesis are types of conjectures used in statistical tests, which are formal methods of reaching conclusions or making judgments on the basis of data. In statistical hypothesis testing, the null hypothesis and alternative hypothesis are two mutually exclusive statements.\n\"The statement being tested in a test of statistical significance is called the null hypothesis. The test of significance is designed to assess the strength of the evidence against the null hypothesis. Usually, the null hypothesis is a statement of 'no effect' or 'no difference'.\" Null hypothesis is often denoted as H0.\nThe statement that is being tested against the null hypothesis is the alternative hypothesis. Alternative hypothesis is often denoted as Ha or H1.\nIn statistical hypothesis testing, to prove the alternative hypothesis is true, it should be shown that the data is contradictory to the null hypothesis. Namely, there is sufficient evidence against null hypothesis to demonstrate that the alternative hypothesis is true.\n", "## Example\n\nOne example is where water quality in a stream has been observed over many years, and a test is made of the null hypothesis that \"there is no change in quality between the first and second halves of the data\", against the alternative hypothesis that \"the quality is poorer in the second half of the record\".\nIf the statistical hypothesis testing is thought of as a judgement in a court trial, the null hypothesis corresponds to the position of the defendant (the defendant is innocent) while the alternative hypothesis is in the rival position of prosecutor (the defendant is guilty). The defendant is innocent until proven guilty, so likewise in a hypothesis test, the null hypothesis is initially presumed to be true. To prove the statement of the prosecutor, evidence must be convincing enough to convict the defendant; this is analogous to sufficient statistical significance in a hypothesis test. \nIn the court, only legal evidence can be considered as the foundation for the trial. As for hypothesis testing, a reasonable test statistic should be set to measure the statistic significance of the null hypothesis. Evidence would support the alternative hypothesis if the null hypothesis is rejected at a certain significance level. However, this does not necessarily mean that the alternative hypothesis is true due to the potential presence of a type I error. In order to quantify the statistical significance, the test statistic variables are assumed to follow a certain probability distribution such as the normal distribution or t-distribution to determine the probability of obtaining test results at least as extreme as the results actually observed, under the assumption that the null hypothesis is correct, which is defined as the p-value. If the p-value is smaller than the chosen significance level (\u03b1), it can be claimed that observed data is sufficiently inconsistent with the null hypothesis and hence the null hypothesis may be rejected. After testing, a valid claim would be \"at the significance level of (\u03b1), the null hypothesis is rejected, supporting the alternative hypothesis instead\". In the metaphor of a trial, the announcement may be \"with tolerance for the probability \u03b1 of an incorrect conviction, the defendant is guilty.\"\n", "## History\n\nThe concept of an alternative hypothesis in testing was devised by Jerzy Neyman and Egon Pearson, and it is used in the Neyman\u2013Pearson lemma. It forms a major component in modern statistical hypothesis testing. However it was not part of Ronald Fisher's formulation of statistical hypothesis testing, and he opposed its use. In Fisher's approach to testing, the central idea is to assess whether the observed dataset could have resulted from chance if the null hypothesis were assumed to hold, notionally without preconceptions about what other models might hold. Modern statistical hypothesis testing accommodates this type of test since the alternative hypothesis can be just the negation of the null hypothesis.\n", "## Types\n\nIn the case of a scalar parameter, there are four principal types  of alternative hypothesis:\n  \u2022 Point. Point alternative hypotheses occur when the hypothesis test is framed so that the population distribution under the alternative hypothesis is a fully defined distribution, with no unknown parameters; such hypotheses are usually of no practical interest but are fundamental to theoretical considerations of statistical inference and are the basis of the Neyman\u2013Pearson lemma.\n  \u2022 One-tailed directional. A one-tailed directional alternative hypothesis is concerned with the region of rejection for only one tail of the sampling distribution.\n  \u2022 Two-tailed directional. A two-tailed directional alternative hypothesis is concerned with both regions of rejection of the sampling distribution.\n  \u2022 Non-directional. A non-directional alternative hypothesis is not concerned with either region of rejection; rather, it is only concerned that null hypothesis is not true.\n"]}
{"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Null_hypothesis", "text_list": ["# Null hypothesis\n\n\nIn scientific research, the null hypothesis (often denoted H0) is the claim that the effect being studied does not exist.  The null hypothesis can also be described as the hypothesis in which no relationship exists between two sets of data or variables being analyzed. If the null hypothesis is true, any experimentally observed effect is due to chance alone, hence the term \"null\". In contrast with the null hypothesis, an alternative hypothesis is developed, which claims that a relationship does exist between two variables.\nAnother way to think of the null hypothesis is the current description of \"normal\". So to say that under normal circumstances, we would assume that situation \"a\" and situation \"b\" have no relationship. But we are noticing some special happening between situation \"a\" and situation \"b\". The null hypothesis would be \"There is no relationship between situation \"a\" and situation \"b.\"\" \n", "## Basic definitions\n\nThe null hypothesis and the alternative hypothesis are types of conjectures used in statistical tests to make statistical inferences, which are formal methods of reaching conclusions and separating scientific claims from statistical noise. \nThe statement being tested in a test of statistical significance is called the null hypothesis. The test of significance is designed to assess the strength of the evidence against the null hypothesis, or a statement of 'no effect' or 'no difference'. It is often symbolized as H0.\nThe statement that is being tested against the null hypothesis is the alternative hypothesis. Symbols may include H1 and Ha.\nA statistical significance test starts with a random sample from a population. If the sample data are consistent with the null hypothesis, then you do not reject the null hypothesis; if the sample data are inconsistent with the null hypothesis, then you reject the null hypothesis and conclude that the alternative hypothesis is true.\nConsider the following example. Given the test scores of two random samples, one of men and one of women, does one group score better than the other? A possible null hypothesis is that the mean male score is the same as the mean female score:\n  H0: \u03bc1 = \u03bc2\nwhere\n  H0 = the null hypothesis,\n  \u03bc1 = the mean of population 1, and\n  \u03bc2 = the mean of population 2.\nA stronger null hypothesis is that the two samples have equal variances and shapes of their respective distributions.\n", "## Terminology\n\nSimple hypothesis\n  Any hypothesis which specifies the population distribution completely. For such a hypothesis the sampling distribution of any statistic is a function of the sample size alone.\n  Composite hypothesis\n  Any hypothesis which does not specify the population distribution completely. Example: A hypothesis specifying a normal distribution with a specified mean and an unspecified variance.\nThe simple/composite distinction was made by Neyman and Pearson.\n  Exact hypothesis\n  Any hypothesis that specifies an exact parameter value. Example: \u03bc = 100. Synonym: point hypothesis.\n  Inexact hypothesis\n  Those specifying a parameter range or interval. Examples: \u03bc \u2264 100; 95 \u2264 \u03bc \u2264 105.\nFisher required an exact null hypothesis for testing (see the quotations below).\nA one-tailed hypothesis (tested using a one-sided test) is an inexact hypothesis in which the value of a parameter is specified as being either:\n  \u2022 above or equal to a certain value, or\n  \u2022 below or equal to a certain value.\nA one-tailed hypothesis is said to have directionality.\nFisher's original (lady tasting tea) example was a one-tailed test. The null hypothesis was asymmetric. The probability of guessing all cups correctly was the same as guessing all cups incorrectly, but Fisher noted that only guessing correctly was compatible with the lady's claim.\n", "## Technical description\n\nThe null hypothesis is a default hypothesis that a quantity to be measured is zero (null). Typically, the quantity to be measured is the difference between two situations. For instance, trying to determine if there is a positive proof that an effect has occurred or that samples derive from different batches.\nThe null hypothesis is generally assumed to remain possibly true. Multiple analyses can be performed to show how the hypothesis should either be rejected or excluded e.g. having a high confidence level, thus demonstrating a statistically significant difference. This is demonstrated by showing that zero is outside of the specified confidence interval of the measurement on either side, typically within the real numbers. Failure to exclude the null hypothesis (with any confidence) does not logically confirm or support the (unprovable) null hypothesis. (When it is proven that something is e.g. bigger than x, it does not necessarily imply it is plausible that it is smaller or equal than x; it may instead be a poor quality measurement with low accuracy. Confirming the null hypothesis two-sided would amount to positively proving it is bigger or equal than 0 and to positively proving it is smaller or equal than 0; this is something for which infinite accuracy is needed as well as exactly zero effect, neither of which normally are realistic. Also measurements will never indicate a non-zero probability of exactly zero difference.) So failure of an exclusion of a null hypothesis amounts to a \"don't know\" at the specified confidence level; it does not immediately imply null somehow, as the data may already show a (less strong) indication for a non-null. The used confidence level does absolutely certainly not correspond to the likelihood of null at failing to exclude; in fact in this case a high used confidence level expands the still plausible range.\nA non-null hypothesis can have the following meanings, depending on the author a) a value other than zero is used, b) some margin other than zero is used and c) the \"alternative\" hypothesis.\nTesting (excluding or failing to exclude) the null hypothesis provides evidence that there are (or are not) statistically sufficient grounds to believe there is a relationship between two phenomena (e.g., that a potential treatment has a non-zero effect, either way). Testing the null hypothesis is a central task in statistical hypothesis testing in the modern practice of science. There are precise criteria for excluding or not excluding a null hypothesis at a certain confidence level. The confidence level should indicate the likelihood that much more and better data would still be able to exclude the null hypothesis on the same side.\nThe concept of a null hypothesis is used differently in two approaches to statistical inference. In the significance testing approach of Ronald Fisher, a null hypothesis is rejected if the observed data are significantly unlikely to have occurred if the null hypothesis were true. In this case, the null hypothesis is rejected and an alternative hypothesis is accepted in its place. If the data are consistent with the null hypothesis statistically possibly true, then the null hypothesis is not rejected. In neither case is the null hypothesis or its alternative proven; with better or more data, the null may still be rejected. This is analogous to the legal principle of presumption of innocence, in which a suspect or defendant is assumed to be innocent (null is not rejected) until proven guilty (null is rejected) beyond a reasonable doubt (to a statistically significant degree).\nIn the hypothesis testing approach of Jerzy Neyman and Egon Pearson, a null hypothesis is contrasted with an alternative hypothesis, and the two hypotheses are distinguished on the basis of data, with certain error rates. It is used in formulating answers in research.\nStatistical inference can be done without a null hypothesis, by specifying a statistical model corresponding to each candidate hypothesis, and by using model selection techniques to choose the most appropriate model. (The most common selection techniques are based on either Akaike information criterion or Bayes factor).\n", "## Principle\n\nHypothesis testing requires constructing a statistical model of what the data would look like if chance or random processes alone were responsible for the results. The hypothesis that chance alone is responsible for the results is called the null hypothesis. The model of the result of the random process is called the distribution under the null hypothesis. The obtained results are compared with the distribution under the null hypothesis, and the likelihood of finding the obtained results is thereby determined.\nHypothesis testing works by collecting data and measuring how likely the particular set of data is (assuming the null hypothesis is true), when the study is on a randomly selected representative sample. The null hypothesis assumes no relationship between variables in the population from which the sample is selected.\nIf the data-set of a randomly selected representative sample is very unlikely relative to the null hypothesis (defined as being part of a class of sets of data that only rarely will be observed), the experimenter rejects the null hypothesis, concluding it (probably) is false. This class of data-sets is usually specified via a test statistic, which is designed to measure the extent of apparent departure from the null hypothesis. The procedure works by assessing whether the observed departure, measured by the test statistic, is larger than a value defined, so that the probability of occurrence of a more extreme value is small under the null hypothesis (usually in less than either 5% or 1% of similar data-sets in which the null hypothesis does hold).\nIf the data do not contradict the null hypothesis, then only a weak conclusion can be made: namely, that the observed data set provides insufficient evidence against the null hypothesis. In this case, because the null hypothesis could be true or false, in some contexts this is interpreted as meaning that the data give insufficient evidence to make any conclusion, while in other contexts, it is interpreted as meaning that there is not sufficient evidence to support changing from a currently useful regime to a different one. Nevertheless, if at this point the effect appears likely and/or large enough, there may be an incentive to further investigate, such as running a bigger sample.\nFor instance, a certain drug may reduce the risk of having a heart attack. Possible null hypotheses are \"this drug does not reduce the risk of having a heart attack\" or \"this drug has no effect on the risk of having a heart attack\". The test of the hypothesis consists of administering the drug to half of the people in a study group as a controlled experiment. If the data show a statistically significant change in the people receiving the drug, the null hypothesis is rejected.\n", "## Goals of null hypothesis tests\n\nThere are many types of significance tests for one, two or more samples, for means, variances and proportions, paired or unpaired data, for different distributions, for large and small samples; all have null hypotheses. There are also at least four goals of null hypotheses for significance tests:\n  \u2022 Technical null hypotheses are used to verify statistical assumptions. For example, the residuals between the data and a statistical model cannot be distinguished from random noise. If true, there is no justification for complicating the model.\n  \u2022 Scientific null assumptions are used to directly advance a theory. For example, the angular momentum of the universe is zero. If not true, the theory of the early universe may need revision.\n  \u2022 Null hypotheses of homogeneity are used to verify that multiple experiments are producing consistent results. For example, the effect of a medication on the elderly is consistent with that of the general adult population. If true, this strengthens the general effectiveness conclusion and simplifies recommendations for use.\n  \u2022 Null hypotheses that assert the equality of effect of two or more alternative treatments, for example, a drug and a placebo, are used to reduce scientific claims based on statistical noise. This is the most popular null hypothesis; It is so popular that many statements about significant testing assume such null hypotheses.\nRejection of the null hypothesis is not necessarily the real goal of a significance tester. An adequate statistical model may be associated with a failure to reject the null; the model is adjusted until the null is not rejected. The numerous uses of significance testing were well known to Fisher who discussed many in his book written a decade before defining the null hypothesis.\nA statistical significance test shares much mathematics with a confidence interval. They are mutually illuminating. A result is often significant when there is confidence in the sign of a relationship (the interval does not include 0). Whenever the sign of a relationship is important, statistical significance is a worthy goal. This also reveals weaknesses of significance testing: A result can be significant without a good estimate of the strength of a relationship; significance can be a modest goal. A weak relationship can also achieve significance with enough data. Reporting both significance and confidence intervals is commonly recommended.\nThe varied uses of significance tests reduce the number of generalizations that can be made about all applications.\n", "## Choice of the null hypothesis\n\nThe choice of the null hypothesis is associated with sparse and inconsistent advice. Fisher mentioned few constraints on the choice and stated that many null hypotheses should be considered and that many tests are possible for each. The variety of applications and the diversity of goals suggests that the choice can be complicated. In many applications the formulation of the test is traditional. A familiarity with the range of tests available may suggest a particular null hypothesis and test. Formulating the null hypothesis is not automated (though the calculations of significance testing usually are). David Cox said, \"How [the] translation from subject-matter problem to statistical model is done is often the most critical part of an analysis\".\nA statistical significance test is intended to test a hypothesis. If the hypothesis summarizes a set of data, there is no value in testing the hypothesis on that set of data. Example: If a study of last year's weather reports indicates that rain in a region falls primarily on weekends, it is only valid to test that null hypothesis on weather reports from any other year. Testing hypotheses suggested by the data is circular reasoning that proves nothing; It is a special limitation on the choice of the null hypothesis.\nA routine procedure is as follows: Start from the scientific hypothesis. Translate this to a statistical alternative hypothesis and proceed: \"Because Ha expresses the effect that we wish to find evidence for, we often begin with Ha and then set up H0 as the statement that the hoped-for effect is not present.\" This advice is reversed for modeling applications where we hope not to find evidence against the null.\nA complex case example is as follows: The gold standard in clinical research is the randomized placebo-controlled double-blind clinical trial. But testing a new drug against a (medically ineffective) placebo may be unethical for a serious illness. Testing a new drug against an older medically effective drug raises fundamental philosophical issues regarding the goal of the test and the motivation of the experimenters. The standard \"no difference\" null hypothesis may reward the pharmaceutical company for gathering inadequate data. \"Difference\" is a better null hypothesis in this case, but statistical significance is not an adequate criterion for reaching a nuanced conclusion which requires a good numeric estimate of the drug's effectiveness. A \"minor\" or \"simple\" proposed change in the null hypothesis ((new vs old) rather than (new vs placebo)) can have a dramatic effect on the utility of a test for complex non-statistical reasons.\n### Directionality\nThe choice of null hypothesis (H0) and consideration of directionality (see \"one-tailed test\") is critical.\n#### Tailedness of the null-hypothesis test\nConsider the question of whether a tossed coin is fair (i.e. that on average it lands heads up 50% of the time) and an experiment where you toss the coin 5 times.\nA possible result of the experiment that we consider here is 5 heads. Let outcomes be considered unlikely with respect to an assumed distribution if their probability is lower than a significance threshold of 0.05.\nA potential null hypothesis implying a one-tailed test is \"this coin is not biased toward heads\". Beware that, in this context, the term \"one-tailed\" does not refer to the outcome of a single coin toss (i.e., whether or not the coin comes up \"tails\" instead of \"heads\"); the term \"one-tailed\" refers to a specific way of testing the null hypothesis in which the critical region (also known as \"region of rejection\") ends up in on only one side of the probability distribution.\nIndeed, with a fair coin the probability of this experiment outcome is 1/2^5 = 0.031, which would be even lower if the coin were biased in favour of tails. \nTherefore, the observations are not likely enough for the null hypothesis to hold, and the test refutes it. \nSince the coin is ostensibly neither fair nor biased toward tails, the conclusion of the experiment is that the coin is biased towards heads.\nAlternatively, a null hypothesis implying a two-tailed test is \"this coin is fair\". \nThis one null hypothesis could be examined by looking out for either too many tails or too many heads in the experiments.\nThe outcomes that would tend to refute this null hypothesis are those with a large number of heads or a large number of tails, and our experiment with 5 heads would seem to belong to this class.\nHowever, the probability of 5 tosses of the same kind, irrespective of whether these are head or tails, is twice as much as that of the 5-head occurrence singly considered.\nHence, under this two-tailed null hypothesis, the observation receives a probability value of 0.063.\nHence again, with the same significance threshold used for the one-tailed test (0.05), the same outcome is not statistically significant.\nTherefore, the two-tailed null hypothesis will be preserved in this case, not supporting the conclusion reached with the single-tailed null hypothesis, that the coin is biased towards heads.\nThis example illustrates that the conclusion reached from a statistical test may depend on the precise formulation of the null and alternative hypotheses.\n#### Discussion\nFisher said, \"the null hypothesis must be exact, that is free of vagueness and ambiguity, because it must supply the basis of the 'problem of distribution,' of which the test of significance is the solution\", implying a more restrictive domain for H0. According to this view, the null hypothesis must be numerically exact\u2014it must state that a particular quantity or difference is equal to a particular number. In classical science, it is most typically the statement that there is no effect of a particular treatment; in observations, it is typically that there is no difference between the value of a particular measured variable and that of a prediction.\nMost statisticians believe that it is valid to state direction as a part of null hypothesis, or as part of a null hypothesis/alternative hypothesis pair. However, the results are not a full description of all the results of an experiment, merely a single result tailored to one particular purpose. For example, consider an H0 that claims the population mean for a new treatment is an improvement on a well-established treatment with population mean = 10 (known from long experience), with the one-tailed alternative being that the new treatment's mean > 10. If the sample evidence obtained through x-bar equals \u2212200 and the corresponding t-test statistic equals \u221250, the conclusion from the test would be that there is no evidence that the new treatment is better than the existing one: it would not report that it is markedly worse, but that is not what this particular test is looking for. To overcome any possible ambiguity in reporting the result of the test of a null hypothesis, it is best to indicate whether the test was two-sided and, if one-sided, to include the direction of the effect being tested.\nThe statistical theory required to deal with the simple cases of directionality dealt with here, and more complicated ones, makes use of the concept of an unbiased test.\nThe directionality of hypotheses is not always obvious. The explicit null hypothesis of Fisher's Lady tasting tea example was that the Lady had no such ability, which led to a symmetric probability distribution. The one-tailed nature of the test resulted from the one-tailed alternate hypothesis (a term not used by Fisher). The null hypothesis became implicitly one-tailed. The logical negation of the Lady's one-tailed claim was also one-tailed. (Claim: Ability > 0; Stated null: Ability = 0; Implicit null: Ability \u2264 0).\nPure arguments over the use of one-tailed tests are complicated by the variety of tests. Some tests (for instance the \u03c7^2 goodness of fit test) are inherently one-tailed. Some probability distributions are asymmetric. The traditional tests of 3 or more groups are two-tailed.\nAdvice concerning the use of one-tailed hypotheses has been inconsistent and accepted practice varies among fields. The greatest objection to one-tailed hypotheses is their potential subjectivity. A non-significant result can sometimes be converted to a significant result by the use of a one-tailed hypothesis (as the fair coin test, at the whim of the analyst). The flip side of the argument: One-sided tests are less likely to ignore a real effect. One-tailed tests can suppress the publication of data that differs in sign from predictions. Objectivity was a goal of the developers of statistical tests.\nIt is a common practice to use a one-tailed hypothesis by default. However, \"If you do not have a specific direction firmly in mind in advance, use a two-sided alternative. Moreover, some users of statistics argue that we should always work with the two-sided alternative.\"\nOne alternative to this advice is to use three-outcome tests. It eliminates the issues surrounding directionality of hypotheses by testing twice, once in each direction and combining the results to produce three possible outcomes. Variations on this approach have a history, being suggested perhaps 10 times since 1950.\nDisagreements over one-tailed tests flow from the philosophy of science. While Fisher was willing to ignore the unlikely case of the Lady guessing all cups of tea incorrectly (which may have been appropriate for the circumstances), medicine believes that a proposed treatment that kills patients is significant in every sense and should be reported and perhaps explained. Poor statistical reporting practices have contributed to disagreements over one-tailed tests. Statistical significance resulting from two-tailed tests is insensitive to the sign of the relationship; Reporting significance alone is inadequate. \"The treatment has an effect\" is the uninformative result of a two-tailed test. \"The treatment has a beneficial effect\" is the more informative result of a one-tailed test. \"The treatment has an effect, reducing the average length of hospitalization by 1.5 days\" is the most informative report, combining a two-tailed significance test result with a numeric estimate of the relationship between treatment and effect. Explicitly reporting a numeric result eliminates a philosophical advantage of a one-tailed test. An underlying issue is the appropriate form of an experimental science without numeric predictive theories: A model of numeric results is more informative than a model of effect signs (positive, negative or unknown) which is more informative than a model of simple significance (non-zero or unknown); in the absence of numeric theory signs may suffice.\n", "## History of statistical tests\n\nThe history of the null and alternative hypotheses has much to do with the history of statistical tests.\n  \u2022 Before 1925: There are occasional transient traces of statistical tests in past centuries, which were early examples of null hypotheses. In the late 19th century statistical significance was defined. In the early 20th century important probability distributions were defined. Gossett and Pearson worked on specific cases of significance testing.\n  \u2022 1925: Fisher published the first edition of Statistical Methods for Research Workers, which defined the statistical significance test and made it a mainstream method of analysis for much of experimental science. The text was devoid of proofs and weak on explanations, but was filled with real examples. It placed statistical practice in the sciences well in advance of published statistical theory.\n  \u2022 1933: In a series of papers (published over a decade starting in 1928) Neyman & Pearson defined the statistical hypothesis test as a proposed improvement on Fisher's test. The papers provided much of the terminology for statistical tests including alternative hypothesis and H0 as a hypothesis to be tested using observational data (with H1, H2... as alternatives).\n  \u2022 1935: Fisher published the first edition of the book The Design of Experiments which introduced the null hypothesis (by example rather than by definition) and carefully explained the rationale for significance tests in the context of the interpretation of experimental results.\n  \u2022 Fisher and Neyman quarreled over the relative merits of their competing formulations until Fisher's death in 1962. Career changes and World War II ended the partnership of Neyman and Pearson. The formulations were merged by relatively anonymous textbook writers, experimenters (journal editors) and mathematical statisticians without input from either Fisher or Neyman. The subject today combines much of the terminology and explanatory power of Neyman & Pearson with the scientific philosophy and calculations provided by Fisher. Whether statistical testing is properly one subject or two remains a source of disagreement. Sample of two: One text refers to the subject as hypothesis testing (with no mention of significance testing in the index) while another says significance testing (with a section on inference as a decision). Fisher developed significance testing as a flexible tool for researchers to weigh their evidence. Instead testing has become institutionalized. Statistical significance has become a rigidly defined and enforced criterion for the publication of experimental results in many scientific journals. In some fields significance testing has become the dominant and nearly exclusive form of statistical analysis. As a consequence the limitations of the tests have been exhaustively studied. Books have been filled with the collected criticism of significance testing.\n"]}
{"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ignoramus_et_ignorabimus", "text_list": ["# Ignoramus et ignorabimus\n\nThe Latin maxim ignoramus et ignorabimus, meaning \"we do not know and will not know\", represents the idea that scientific knowledge is limited. It was popularized by Emil du Bois-Reymond, a German physiologist, in his 1872 address \"\u00dcber die Grenzen des Naturerkennens\" (\"The Limits of Science\").\n", "## Seven \"World Riddles\"\n\nEmil du Bois-Reymond first used the words \"ignoramus\" and \"ignorabimus\" at the close of his keynote address to the 1872 Congress of German Scientists and Physicians. As he saw it, science was bounded by two limits: the ultimate nature of matter and the enigma of consciousness. Eight years later, in a speech before the Prussian Academy of Sciences, he expanded his list of conundrums to seven \"world riddles\" or \"shortcomings\" of science. Three of these he declared to be \"transcendent\", or permanently unknowable: \"1. the ultimate nature of matter and energy, 2. the origin of motion, ... 5. the origin of simple sensations.\"\n", "## Hilbert's reaction\n\nDavid Hilbert, a widely-respected German mathematician, suggested that such a conceptualization of human knowledge was too pessimistic, and that by considering questions unsolvable we limit our understanding.\nIn 1900, during an address to the International Congress of Mathematicians in Paris, Hilbert suggested that answers to problems of mathematics are possible with human effort.  He declared, \"in mathematics there is no ignorabimus\", and he worked with other formalists to establish foundations for mathematics during the early 20th century.\nOn 8 September 1930, Hilbert elaborated his opinion in a celebrated address to the Society of German Scientists and Physicians, in K\u00f6nigsberg:\n    We must not believe those, who today, with philosophical bearing and deliberative tone, prophesy the fall of culture and accept the ignorabimus. For us there is no ignorabimus, and in my opinion none whatever in natural science. In opposition to the foolish ignorabimus our slogan shall be Wir m\u00fcssen wissen \u2013 wir werden wissen (\"We must know \u2013 we will know\").\nAnswers to some of Hilbert's 23 problems were found during the 20th century. Some have been answered definitively; some have not yet been solved; a few, most notably Cantor's continuum hypothesis, have been shown to be undecidable on the basis of currently accepted principles.\nIn 1931, G\u00f6del's incompleteness theorems showed that for any formal system of mathematics satisfying certain minimal requirements, there exist questions that cannot be answered within that system. While this does not exclude that the question can be answered unambiguously in another system, the incompleteness theorems are generally taken to imply that Hilbert's hopes for proving the consistency of mathematics using purely finitistic methods were unfounded. As this excludes the possibility of an absolute proof of consistency, there must always remain an ineliminable degree of insecurity about the foundations of mathematics: we will never be capable of knowing, once and for all, with a certainty unimpeachable even by the most stout skepticism, that there is no contradiction in our basic theories. (Note that this does not mean that such skepticism is rational; it only means that it cannot be refuted with absolute rigour.)\n", "## Other responses\n\nThe sociologist Wolf Lepenies discussed the Ignorabimus with the opinion that du Bois-Reymond was not really pessimistic about science:\n    ...\u00a0it is in fact an incredibly self-confident support for scientific hubris masked as modesty\u00a0...\nThis was in regards to Friedrich Wolters, one of the members of the literary group \"George-Kreis\". Lepenies thought that Wolters misunderstood the degree of pessimism being expressed about science, but understood the implication that scientists themselves could be trusted with self-criticism.\nLepenies was repeating the criticism, first leveled in 1874 by du Bois-Reymond's rival Ernst Haeckel, that the \"seemingly humble but actually presumptuous Ignorabimus is the Ignoratis of the infallible Vatican and of the 'Black International' which it heads.\" Haeckel overstated his charge: du Bois-Reymond had never supported the Catholic Church, and far from professing humility he reminded his audience that while our knowledge was indeed bounded by mysteries of matter and mind, within these limits \"the man of science is lord and master; he can analyze and synthesize, and no one can fathom the extent of his knowledge and power\".\nIn response to his critics du Bois-Reymond modified his watchword in \"The Seven World Riddles\" (1880) to that of \"Dubitemus\" (\"We doubt it.\")\nWilliam James referred to \"Ignoramus, ignorabimus\" in his lecture \"Reflex Action and Theism\" (1881) as an expression of agnosticism, which gives man no practical tools for his volitions. James had attended du Bois-Reymond's lectures in Berlin.\n\nThe Quarterly Review also regarded the maxim as the ensign of agnosticism:To the average citizen who reads as he runs, and who is unacquainted with any tongue save his native British, it may well appear that the Gospel of Unbelief, preached among us during the last half-century, has had its four Evangelists\u2013the Quadrilateral, as they have been called, whose works and outworks, demilunes and frowning bastions, take the public eye, while above them floats the agnostic banner with its strange device, \"Ignoramus et Ignorabimus.\" \nThe issue of whether science has limits continues to attract scholarly attention.\n"]}
{"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intertheoretic_reduction", "text_list": ["# Intertheoretic reduction\n\nIn philosophy of science, intertheoretic reduction occurs when a reducing theory makes predictions that perfectly or almost perfectly match the predictions of a reduced theory, while the reducing theory explains or predicts a wider range of phenomena under more general conditions. Special relativity, for example, can be reduced to  Newtonian mechanics for speeds far less than c.\nAccording to Alexander Rosenberg philosophers mostly these days believe that reduction between sciences is possible in principle but concepts we currently have do not allow reductions even in many cases in which natural sciences are involved, for instance from biology to chemistry.\nOften, the extent to which one theory can be said to be reduced to another theory is complicated by the existence of emergent phenomena. Furthermore, there is the issue of by what criteria one judges one theory as more fundamental than another. Often, this notion is ambiguous. For instance, a quintessential example of intertheoretic reduction is often considered to be the reduction of phenomenological thermodynamics to statistical mechanics. However, it has been argued that there are some phenomena (e.g. phase transitions and critical phenomena) that cannot be reductively explicated in terms of the \"more fundamental\" theory of statistical mechanics.\nEspecially psychology is seen often as a \"scientific dead-end\" due to its intentional concepts (though psychology does not necessarily have to use intentional concepts). Logical analysis has suggested that intentional concepts are not reducible to non-intentional concepts used by neurophysiology in which is the discipline \"underlying\" the psychology.\n"]}
{"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence-based_practice", "text_list": ["# Evidence-based practice\n\nEvidence-based practice is the idea that occupational practices ought to be based on scientific evidence. The movement towards evidence-based practices attempts to encourage and, in some instances, require professionals and other decision-makers to pay more attention to evidence to inform their decision-making. The goal of evidence-based practice is to eliminate unsound or outdated practices in favor of more-effective ones by shifting the basis for decision making from tradition, intuition, and unsystematic experience to firmly grounded scientific research. The proposal has been controversial, with some arguing that results may not specialize to individuals as well as traditional practices.\nEvidence-based practices have been gaining ground since the formal introduction of evidence-based medicine in 1992 and have spread to the allied health professions, education, management, law, public policy, architecture, and other fields.  In light of studies showing problems in scientific research (such as the replication crisis), there is also a movement to apply evidence-based practices in scientific research itself. Research into the evidence-based practice of science is called metascience.\nAn individual or organisation is justified in claiming that a specific practice is evidence-based if, and only if, three conditions are met. First, the individual or organisation possesses comparative evidence about the effects of the specific practice in comparison to the effects of at least one alternative practice. Second, the specific practice is supported by this evidence according to at least one of the individual's or organisation's preferences in the given practice area. Third, the individual or organisation can provide a sound account for this support by explaining the evidence and preferences that lay the foundation for the claim.\n", "## History\n\nFor most of history, professions have based their practices on expertise derived from experience passed down in the form of tradition. Many of these practices have not been justified by evidence, which has sometimes enabled quackery and poor performance. Even when overt quackery is not present, the quality and efficiency of tradition-based practices may not be optimal. As the scientific method has become increasingly recognized as a sound means to evaluate practices, evidence-based practices have become increasingly adopted.\n### Medicine\nOne of the earliest proponents of evidence-based practice was Archie Cochrane, an epidemiologist who authored the book Effectiveness and Efficiency: Random Reflections on Health Services in 1972. Cochrane's book argued for the importance of properly testing health care strategies, and was foundational to the evidence-based practice of medicine. Cochrane suggested that because resources would always be limited, they should be used to provide forms of health care which had been shown in properly designed evaluations to be effective. Cochrane maintained that the most reliable evidence was that which came from randomised controlled trials.\nThe term \"evidence-based medicine\" was introduced by Gordon Guyatt in 1990 in an unpublished program description, and the term was later first published in 1992. This marked the first evidence-based practice to be formally established. Some early experiments in evidence-based medicine involved testing primitive medical techniques such as bloodletting, and studying the effectiveness of modern and accepted treatments. There has been a push for evidence-based practices in medicine by insurance providers, which have sometimes refused coverage of practices lacking systematic evidence of usefulness. It is now expected by most clients that medical professionals should make decisions based on evidence, and stay informed about the most up-to-date information. Since the widespread adoption of evidence-based practices in medicine, the use of evidence-based practices has rapidly spread to other fields.\n### Education\nMore recently, there has been a push for evidence-based education. The use of evidence-based learning techniques such as spaced repetition can improve students' rate of learning. Some commentators have suggested that the lack of any substantial progress in the field of education is attributable to practice resting in the unconnected and noncumulative experience of thousands of individual teachers, each re-inventing the wheel and failing to learn from hard scientific evidence about 'what works'. Opponents of this view argue that it is hard to assess teaching methods because it depends on a host of factors, not least those to do with the style, personality and beliefs of the teacher and the needs of the particular children. Others argue the teacher experience could be combined with research evidence, but without the latter being treated as a privileged source. This is in line with a school of thought suggesting that evidence-based practice has limitations and a better alternative is to use Evidence-informed Practice (EIP). This process includes quantitative evidence, does not include non-scientific prejudices, but includes qualitative factors such as clinical experience and the discernment of practitioners and clients.\n", "## Versus tradition\n\nEvidence-based practice is a philosophical approach that is in opposition to tradition. Some degree of reliance on \"the way it was always done\" can be found in almost every profession, even when those practices are contradicted by new and better information.\nSome critics argue that since research is conducted on a population level, results may not generalise to each individual within the population. Therefore, evidence-based practices may fail to provide the best solution for each individual, and traditional practices may better accommodate individual differences. In response, researchers have made an effort to test whether particular practices work better for different subcultures, personality types etc. Some authors have redefined evidence-based practice to include practice that incorporates common wisdom, tradition, and personal values alongside practices based on evidence.\n", "## Evaluating evidence\n\nEvaluating scientific research is extremely complex. The process can be greatly simplified with the use of a heuristic that ranks the relative strengths of results obtained from scientific research, which is called a hierarchy of evidence. The design of the study and the endpoints measured (such as survival or quality of life) affect the strength of the evidence. Typically, systematic reviews and meta-analysis rank at the top of the hierarchy while randomized controlled trials rank above observational studies, and expert opinion and case reports rank at the bottom. There is broad agreement on the relative strength of the different types of studies, but there is no single, universally-accepted hierarchy of evidence. More than 80 different hierarchies have been proposed for assessing medical evidence.\n", "## Applications\n\n### Medicine\nEvidence-based medicine is an approach to medical practice intended to optimize decision-making by emphasizing the use of evidence from well-designed and well-conducted research. Although all medicine based on science has some degree of empirical support, evidence-based medicine goes further, classifying evidence by its epistemologic strength and requiring that only the strongest types (coming from meta-analyses, systematic reviews, and randomized controlled trials) can yield strong recommendations; weaker types (such as from case-control studies) can yield only weak recommendations. The term was originally used to describe an approach to teaching the practice of medicine and improving decisions by individual physicians about individual patients. Use of the term rapidly expanded to include a previously described approach that emphasized the use of evidence in the design of guidelines and policies that apply to groups of patients and populations (\"evidence-based practice policies\").\nWhether applied to medical education, decisions about individuals, guidelines and policies applied to populations, or administration of health services in general, evidence-based medicine advocates that to the greatest extent possible, decisions and policies should be based on evidence, not just the beliefs of practitioners, experts, or administrators. It thus tries to ensure that a clinician's opinion, which may be limited by knowledge gaps or biases, is supplemented with all available knowledge from the scientific literature so that best practice can be determined and applied. It promotes the use of formal, explicit methods to analyze evidence and makes it available to decision makers. It promotes programs to teach the methods to medical students, practitioners, and policymakers.\nA process has been specified that provides a standardised route for those seeking to produce evidence of the effectiveness of interventions. Originally developed to establish processes for the production of evidence in the housing sector, the standard is general in nature and is applicable across a variety of practice areas and potential outcomes of interest.\n### Mental health\nTo improve the dissemination of evidence-based practices, the Association for Behavioral and Cognitive Therapies (ABCT) and the Society of Clinical Child and Adolescent Psychology (SCCAP, Division 53 of the American Psychological Association) maintain updated information on their websites on evidence-based practices in psychology for practitioners and the general public. An evidence-based practice consensus statement was developed at a summit on mental healthcare in 2018. As of June 23, 2019, this statement has been endorsed by 36 organizations.\n### Metascience\nThere has since been a movement for the use of evidence-based practice in conducting scientific research in an attempt to address the replication crisis and other major issues affecting scientific research. The application of evidence-based practices to research itself is called metascience, which seeks to increase the quality of scientific research while reducing waste. It is also known as \"research on research\" and \"the science of science\", as it uses research methods to study how research is done and where improvements can be made. The five main areas of research in metascience are methodology, reporting, reproducibility, evaluation, and incentives. Metascience has produced a number of reforms in science such as the use of study pre-registration and the implementation of reporting guidelines with the goal of bettering scientific research practices.\n### Education\nEvidence-based education (EBE), also known as evidence-based interventions, is a model in which policy-makers and educators use empirical evidence to make informed decisions about education interventions (policies, practices, and programs). In other words, decisions are based on scientific evidence rather than opinion.\nEBE has gained attention since English author David H. Hargreaves suggested in 1996 that education would be more effective if teaching, like medicine, was a \"research-based profession\".\nSince 2000, studies in Australia, England, Scotland and the US have supported the use of research to improve educational practices in teaching reading.\nIn 1997, the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development convened a national panel to assess the effectiveness of different approaches used to teach children to read. The resulting National Reading Panel examined quantitative research studies on many areas of reading instruction, including phonics and whole language. In 2000 it published a report entitled Teaching Children to Read: An Evidence-based Assessment of the Scientific Research Literature on Reading and its Implications for Reading Instruction that provided a comprehensive review of what was known about best practices in reading instruction in the U.S.\nThis occurred around the same time as such international studies as the Programme for International Student Assessment  in 2000 and the Progress in International Reading Literacy Study in 2001.\nSubsequently, evidence-based practice in education (also known as Scientifically based research), came into prominence in the U.S. under the No child left behind act of 2001, replace in 2015 by the Every Student Succeeds Act.\nIn 2002 the U.S. Department of Education founded the Institute of Education Sciences to provide scientific evidence to guide education practice and policy .\nEnglish author Ben Goldacre advocated in 2013 for systemic change and more randomized controlled trials to assess the effects of educational interventions. In 2014 the National Foundation for Educational Research, Berkshire, England published a report entitled Using Evidence in the Classroom: What Works and Why. In 2014 the British Educational Research Association and the Royal Society of Arts advocated for a closer working partnership between teacher-researchers and the wider academic research community.\n#### Reviews of existing research on education\nThe following websites offer free analysis and information on education research:\n  \u2022 The Best Evidence Encyclopedia is a free website created by the Johns Hopkins University School of Education's Center for Data-Driven Reform in Education (established in 2004) and is funded by the Institute of Education Sciences, U.S. Department of Education.  It gives educators and researchers reviews about the strength of the evidence supporting a variety of English programs available for students in grades K\u201312. The reviews cover programs in areas such as Mathematics, Reading, Writing, Science, Comprehensive school reform, and Early childhood Education; and include such topics as the effectiveness of technology and struggling readers.\n  \u2022 The Education Endowment Foundation was established in 2011 by The Sutton Trust, as a lead charity in partnership with Impetus Trust, together being the government-designated What Works Centre for UK Education.\n  \u2022 Evidence for the Every Student Succeeds Act began in 2017 and is produced by the Center for Research and Reform in Education at Johns Hopkins University School of Education. It offers free up-to-date information on current PK-12 programs in reading, writing, math, science, and others that meet the standards of the Every Student Succeeds Act (the United States K\u201312 public education policy signed by President Obama in 2015).

{"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_pluralism", "text_list": ["# Scientific pluralism\n\nScientific pluralism is a position within the philosophy of science that rejects various proposed unities of scientific method and subject matter. Scientific pluralists hold that science is not unified in one or more of the following ways: the metaphysics of its subject matter, the epistemology of scientific knowledge, or the research methods and models that should be used. Some pluralists believe that pluralism is necessary due to the nature of science. Others say that since scientific disciplines already vary in practice, there is no reason to believe this variation is wrong until a specific unification is empirically proven. Finally, some hold that pluralism should be allowed for normative reasons, even if unity were possible in theory.\n", "## History\n\nSince the development of logical positivism by the Vienna Circle in the 1920s and 1930s, theories of unified science have posited that all scientific investigation shares a common framework. In the strongest versions of these theories, all of the special sciences should be reducible to physics. Therefore all science could in theory follow one shared methodology and be described in a shared jargon, even if in current practice this is not the case due to limitations in the development of human knowledge and technology. The specific theories of the Vienna Circle are no longer commonly held, but there are a variety of unities proposed by more recent philosophers.\nAlthough earlier pluralistic conceptions of science persisted during the rise of positivism, modern conceptions of scientific pluralism began to emerge in the 1970s. In a 1978 address to the Philosophy of Science Association, Stanford University professor Patrick Suppes argued against what he called \"reduction of language, reduction of subject matter, and reduction of method\" in science. He positioned his talk as a response to ideas in the first volume of the International Encyclopedia of Unified Science, which was published in 1938. He argued that since that time the subjects of scientific disciplines had become more differentiated, with greater divergences in language and methodology, showing no move toward the unities posited by the encyclopedia's Vienna Circle authors. Other members of what came to be called the \"Stanford School\" supporting scientific pluralism were Nancy Cartwright, John Dupr\u00e9, Peter Galison, and Ian Hacking. In the 2000s, a \"Minnesota School\" emerged following a 2002 workshop at the University of Minnesota's Center for the Philosophy of Science, including Stephen Kellert, Helen Longino, and C. Kenneth Waters. These authors criticized some arguments from earlier pluralists, while also arguing that pluralism should be accepted as a standard approach to science. These newer pluralists also sought to address areas outside those traditionally disputed with unity of science proponents, including metascientific and metaphilosophical concerns.\n", "## Varieties of pluralism\n\nScientific pluralists vary in regard to what aspects of science they believe are not unified. Pluralists who believe in metaphysical differences within the subject matter of science hold that unity of science is inherently impossible. In the words of pluralist Nancy Cartwright, they reject the \"fundamentalist doctrine\" that \"all facts must belong to one grand scheme\". The posited impact of these differences depends on the specific metaphysical differences proposed. Opponents of reductionism, for example, say that sciences such as sociology and psychology cannot be fully unified with physics because they involve different levels of facts that cannot be reduced to one another. However, in this model there may be unity within each discipline. In contrast, some pluralists posit that there may be multiple types of causality, so that a discipline such as physics might need different methods for understanding entities with deterministic behaviors versus those with probabilistic behaviors.\nAnother focus of pluralism is on the epistemology of science. Some pluralists focus on the difficulties of relating material from different scientific disciplines. Even if reductionist metaphysics are accepted in theory, it may be impossible in practice to explain, for example, large-scale social behaviors by reference to the behavior of subatomic particles, given the amount of information that would be required. Other pluralists do not dismiss the possibility of such an explanation at an epistemological level, but say that given the varied research methods and theoretical models actually used in different disciplines (and sometimes even within a discipline), the burden of proof is on the unifiers to provide empirical evidence of unity across them. In the absence of that evidence, these pluralists believe it makes more sense for scientists to use the methods and models that appear to be most effective for their work, without any special consideration for theories of unity.\nSome proponents of scientific pluralism argue that it should be adopted for social, ethical, and political reasons. For example, Sandra Harding says that a unified model of science invariably means on one based on Western culture, which leads to \"destruction of the resources and the rights of other cultures\" and only \"an intensely authoritarian global society\" could actually impose a single view of science across all cultures. Some pluralists expect pluralism to provide more opportunities for previously marginalized groups to participate, and more opportunity for airing of scientific dissent.\n"]}

There are two components to testability:\n  1. Falsifiability or defeasibility, which means that counterexamples to the hypothesis are logically possible.\n  2. The practical feasibility of observing a reproducible series of such counterexamples if they do exist.\nIn short, a hypothesis is testable if there is a possibility of deciding whether it is true or false based on experimentation by anyone. This allows anyone to decide whether a theory can be supported or refuted by data. However, the interpretation of experimental data may be also inconclusive or uncertain. Karl Popper introduced the concept that scientific knowledge had the property of falsifiability as published in The Logic of Scientific Discovery.\n"]}

If two theories could not, for practical reasons, be tested one should prefer the one with the highest degree of empirical content, said Popper in The Logic of Scientific Discovery.\nMathematician and physicist Henri Poincar\u00e9 instead, like many others, proposed simplicity as a criterion. One should choose the mathematically simplest or most elegant approach. Many have sympathized with this view, but the problem is that the idea of simplicity is highly intuitive and even personal, and that no one has managed to formulate it in precise and acceptable terms.\nPopper's solution was subsequently criticized by Thomas S. Kuhn in The Structure of Scientific Revolutions. He denied that competing theories (or paradigms) could be compared in the way that Popper had claimed, and substituted instead what can be briefly described as pragmatic success. This led to an intense discussion with Imre Lakatos and Paul Feyerabend the best known participants.\nThe discussion has continued, but no general and uncontroversial solution to the problem of formulating objective criteria to decide which is the best theory has so far been formulated. The main criteria usually proposed are to choose the theory which provides the best (and novel) predictions, the one with the highest explanatory potential, the one which offers better problems or the most elegant and simple one. Alternatively a theory may be preferable if it is better integrated into the rest of contemporary knowledge.\n\n"]}

Attributes are closely related to variables. A variable is a logical set of attributes. Variables can \"vary\" \u2013 for example, be high or low. How high, or how low, is determined by the value of the attribute (and in fact, an attribute could be just the word \"low\" or \"high\"). (For example see: Binary option)\nWhile an attribute is often intuitive, the variable is the operationalized way in which the attribute is represented for further data processing. In data processing data are often represented by a combination of items (objects organized in rows), and multiple variables (organized in columns).\nValues of each variable statistically \"vary\" (or are distributed) across the variable's domain. A domain is a set of all possible values that a variable is allowed to have. The values are ordered in a logical way and must be defined for each variable. Domains can be bigger or smaller. The smallest possible domains have those variables that can only have two values, also called binary (or dichotomous) variables. Bigger domains have non-dichotomous variables and the ones with a higher level of measurement. (See also domain of discourse.)\nSemantically, greater precision can be obtained when considering an object's characteristics by distinguishing 'attributes' (characteristics that are attributed to an object) from 'traits' (characteristics that are inherent to the object).\n", "## Examples\n\nAge is an attribute that can be operationalized in many ways. It can be dichotomized so that only two values \u2013 \"old\" and \"young\" \u2013 are allowed for further data processing. In this case the attribute \"age\" is operationalized as a binary variable. If more than two values are possible and they can be ordered, the attribute is represented by ordinal variable, such as \"young\", \"middle age\", and \"old\". Next it can be made of rational values, such as 1, 2, 3.... 99.\nThe \"social class\" attribute can be operationalized in similar ways as age, including \"lower\", \"middle\" and \"upper class\" and each class could be differentiated between upper and lower, transforming thus changing the three attributes into six (see the model proposed by William Lloyd Warner) or it could use different terminology (such as the working class as in the model by Gilbert and Kahl).\n"]}

Control variables could strongly influence experimental results were they not held constant during the experiment in order to test the relative relationship of the dependent variable (DV) and independent variable (IV). The control variables themselves are not of primary interest to the experimenter.\n\"Good controls\", also known as \u201cconfounders\u201d or \u201cdeconfounders\u201d, are variables which are theorized to be unaffected by the treatment and which are intended to eliminate omitted-variable bias. \"Bad controls\", on the other hand, are variables that could be affected by the treatment, might contribute to collider bias, and lead to erroneous results.\n", "## Usage\n\nA variable in an experiment which is held constant in order to assess the relationship between multiple variables, is a control variable. A control variable is an element that is not changed throughout an experiment because its unchanging state allows better understanding of the relationship between the other variables being tested.\nIn any system existing in a natural state, many variables may be interdependent, with each affecting the other.  Scientific experiments test the relationship of an IV (or independent variable: that element that is manipulated by the experimenter) to the DV (or dependent variable: that element affected by the manipulation of the IV).  Any additional independent variable can be a control variable.  \nA control variable is an experimental condition or element that is kept the same throughout the experiment, and it is not of primary concern in the experiment, nor will it influence the outcome of the experiment. Any unexpected (e.g.: uncontrolled) change in a control variable during an experiment would invalidate the correlation of dependent variables (DV) to the independent variable (IV), thus skewing the results, and invalidating the working hypothesis. This indicates the presence of a spurious relationship existing within experimental parameters. Unexpected results may result from the presence of a confounding variable, thus requiring a re-working of the initial experimental hypothesis. Confounding variables are a threat to the internal validity of an experiment. This situation may be resolved by first identifying the confounding variable and then redesigning the experiment taking that information into consideration. One way to this is to control the confounding variable, thus making it a control variable. If, however, the spurious relationship cannot be identified, the working hypothesis may have to be abandoned.\n", "## Experimental examples\n\nTake, for example, the well known combined gas law, which is stated mathematically as:\n$\\qquad {\\frac {PV}{T}}=k$ \nwhere:\n  P is the pressure\n  V is the volume\n  T is the thermodynamic temperature measured in kelvins\n  k is a constant (with units of energy divided by temperature).\n  which shows that the ratio between the pressure-volume product and the temperature of a system remains constant.\nIn an experimental verification of parts of the combined gas law, (P * V = T), where Pressure, Temperature, and Volume are all variables, to test the resultant changes to any of these variables requires at least one to be kept constant. This is in order to see comparable experimental results in the remaining variables. \nIf Temperature is made the control variable and it is not allowed to change throughout the course of the experiment, the relationship between the dependent variables, Pressure, and Volume, can quickly be established by changing the value for one or the other, and this is Boyle's law. For instance, if the Pressure is raised then the Volume must decrease.\nIf, however, Volume is made the control variable and it is not allowed to change throughout the course of the experiment, the relationship between dependent variables, Pressure, and Temperature,  can quickly be established by changing the value for one or the other, and this is Gay-Lussac's Law.

While it is sometimes referred to as an empiricist form of structuralism, its main proponent, Bas van Fraassen, has consistently distinguished between the two views.\n", "## Overview\n\nBas van Fraassen is nearly solely responsible for the initial development of constructive empiricism; its historically most important presentation appears in his The Scientific Image (1980). Constructive empiricism states that scientific theories are semantically literal, that they aim to be empirically adequate, and that their acceptance involves, as belief, only that they are empirically adequate. A theory is empirically adequate if and only if everything that it says about observable entities is true (regardless of what it says about unobservable entities). A theory is semantically literal if and only if the language of the theory is interpreted in such a way that the claims of the theory are either true or false (as opposed to an instrumentalist reading).\nConstructive empiricism is thus a normative, semantic and epistemological thesis.  That science aims to be empirically adequate expresses the normative component. That scientific theories are semantically literal expresses the semantic component. That acceptance involves, as belief, only that a theory is empirically adequate expresses the epistemological component.\nConstructive empiricism opposes scientific realism, logical positivism (or logical empiricism) and instrumentalism. Constructive empiricism and scientific realism agree that theories are semantically literal, which logical positivism and instrumentalism deny. Constructive empiricism, logical positivism and instrumentalism agree that theories do not aim for truth about unobservables, which scientific realism denies.\nConstructive empiricism has been used to analyze various scientific fields, from physics to psychology (especially computational psychology).\n"]}
{"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constructive_realism", "text_list": ["# Constructive realism\n\nConstructive realism is a branch of philosophy, specifically the philosophy of science. It was developed in the late 1950s by Jane Loevinger and elaborated in the 1980s by Friedrich Wallner (also Fritz Wallner) in Vienna. In his paper abstract on constructive realism, Wallner describes it as follows:Traditional convictions regarding science (such as universalism, necessity and eternal validity) are currently in doubt. Relativism seems to destroy scientific claims to rationality. This paper shows a way to keep the traditional convictions of scientific knowledge while acknowledging relativism. With reference to the practicing scientist, we replace descriptivism with constructivism; we modify relative validity with the claim to understanding; and, we offer methodological strategies for acquiring understanding. These strategies we call strangification, which means taking a scientific proposition system out of its context and putting it in another context. We can thus see the implicit presuppositions of the given proposition system by means of the problems arising out of the application of this procedure. Such a change in the understanding of science holds important consequences.\nWithin the philosophy of measurement, Jane Loevinger  described the relation between a construct (scientific model or construction of reality) and the reality itself.  Now referred to as \"Construct Realism\", recognized chiefly in philosophy of measurement (psychometrics), Loevinger's view is expressed in the following quote in the context of real human traits (cognitive and/or behavioral patterns that tend to occur together):A dictionary (122) definition of construct is: \"Something constructed; specif., Psychol., an intellectual synthesis.\" In the present paper both construct and trait are used in their general or dictionary meanings. Connotations of depth, level, or locus are specifically disclaimed. Traits exist in people; constructs (here usually about traits) exist in the minds and magazines of psychologists.  People have constructs too, but that is outside the present scope. Construct connotes construction and artifice; yet what is at issue is validity with respect to exactly what the psychologist does not construct: the validity of the test as a measure of traits which exist prior to and independently of the psychologist's act of measuring. It is true that psychologists never know traits directly but only through the glass of their constructs, but the data to be judged are manifestations of traits, not manifestations of constructs. Cronbach and Meehl and their colleagues on the APA committee appear reluctant to assign reality to constructs or traits. Considering traits as real is, in the present view, a working stance and not a philosophical tenet.\" [Italics added]\n    That the distinction made here between traits and constructs is free of metaphysical implications is seen by comparing it to the familiar distinction between parameter and statistic. The parameter is what we aim to estimate; the corresponding statistic represents our current best estimate of it. Just so, the trait is what we aim to understand, and the corresponding construct represents our current best understanding of it. The distinction between trait and construct can be dispensed with no better than the distinction between parameter and statistic.\n"]}
{"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inductionism", "text_list": ["# Inductionism\n\nInductionism is the scientific philosophy where laws are \"induced\" from sets of data.  As an example, one might measure the strength of electrical forces at varying distances from charges and induce the inverse square law of electrostatics. This concept is considered one of the two pillars of the old view of the philosophy of science, together with verifiability. An application of inductionism can show how experimental evidence can confirm or inductively justify the belief in generalization and the laws of nature.\n", "## Origin and development\n\nSome aspects of induction has been credited to Aristotle. For example, in Prior Analytics, he proposed an inductive syllogism, which served to establish the primary and immediate proposition. For scholars, this constitutes the principle of demonstrative science. The Greek philosopher, however, did not develop a detailed theory of induction. Some sources even state that the Aristotelian conceptualization of induction is different from its modern mainstream interpretations due to its position that inductive arguments are deductively valid. \nThe early form of modern inductionism is associated with the philosophies of thinkers such as Francis Bacon. This can be demonstrated in the way Bacon favored the steady and incremental collection of empirical evidence using a method that derives general principles from the senses and particulars, gradually leading to the most general principles.\nInductionism is also said to be based on Newtonian physics. This is evident in Isaac Newton's Rule of Reasoning in Philosophy, which articulated his belief that it is imperative to cover the unobservably small features of the world through a methodology that has a strong empirical base. Here, the speculative hypothesis was replaced by induction from premises obtained through observation and experiment.\n", "## Opposing views\n\nIt is noted that no law of science can be considered mere inductive generalization of facts because each law does not exist in isolation. This is for, instance, demonstrated by thinkers such as John Stuart Mill, who maintained that inductionism is the initial act in the formulation of a general law using the deductive approaches to science. There are thinkers who propose a model that is considered anti-inductionism. These include Karl Popper, who argued that science could progress without making any use of induction and that there is a fundamental asymmetry between induction and deduction.\n"]}

It claims that it is meaningless to talk about the \"true reality\" of a model as we can never be absolutely certain of anything. The only meaningful thing is the usefulness of the model. The term \"model-dependent realism\" was coined by Stephen Hawking and Leonard Mlodinow in their 2010 book, The Grand Design.\n", "## Overview\n\nModel-dependent realism asserts that all we can know about \"reality\" consists of networks of world pictures that explain observations by connecting them by rules to concepts defined in models. Will an ultimate theory of everything be found? Hawking and Mlodinow suggest it is unclear:\n    In the history of science we have discovered a sequence of better and better theories or models, from Plato to the classical theory of Newton to modern quantum theories. It is natural to ask: Will this sequence eventually reach an end point, an ultimate theory of the universe, that will include all forces and predict every observation we can make, or will we continue forever finding better theories, but never one that cannot be improved upon? We do not yet have a definitive answer to this question...\u2014\u200aStephen Hawking & Leonard Mlodinow, The Grand Design, p. 8\nA world picture consists of the combination of a set of observations accompanied by a conceptual model and by rules connecting the model concepts to the observations. Different world pictures that describe particular data equally well all have equal claims to be valid. There is no requirement that a world picture be unique, or even that the data selected include all available observations. The universe of all observations at present is covered by a network of overlapping world pictures and, where overlap occurs; multiple, equally valid, world pictures exist. At present, science requires multiple models to encompass existing observations:\n    Like the overlapping maps in a Mercator projection, where the ranges of different versions overlap, they predict the same phenomena. But just as there is no flat map that is a good representation of the earth's entire surface, there is no single theory that is a good representation of observations in all situations\u2014\u200aStephen Hawking & Leonard Mlodinow, The Grand Design, p. 9\n Where several models are found for the same phenomena, no single model is preferable to the others within that domain of overlap.\n", "## Model selection\n\nWhile not rejecting the idea of \"reality-as-it-is-in-itself\", model-dependent realism suggests that we cannot know \"reality-as-it-is-in-itself\", but only an approximation of it provided by the intermediary of models. The view of models in model-dependent realism also is related to the instrumentalist approach to modern science, that a concept or theory should be evaluated by how effectively it explains and predicts phenomena, as opposed to how accurately it describes objective reality (a matter possibly impossible to establish). A model is a good model if it:\n  1. Is elegant\n  2. Contains few arbitrary or adjustable elements\n  3. Agrees with and explains all existing observations\n  4. Makes detailed predictions about future observations that can disprove or falsify the model if they are not borne out.\n\"If the modifications needed to accommodate new observations become too baroque, it signals the need for a new model.\" Of course, an assessment like that is subjective, as are the other criteria.

It is viewed as an important part of the scientific method, especially in the physical sciences.\n", "## Levels of formalism\n\nThere are multiple levels of scientific formalism possible. At the lowest level, scientific formalism deals with the symbolic manner in which the information is presented. To achieve formalism in a scientific theory at this level, one starts with a well defined set of axioms, and from this follows a formal system.\nHowever, at a higher level, scientific formalism also involves consideration of the axioms themselves. These can be viewed as questions of ontology. For example, one can, at the lower level of formalism, define a property called 'existence'. However, at the higher level, the question of whether an electron exists in the same sense that a bacterium exists still needs to be resolved.\nSome actual formal theories on facts have been proposed.\n", "## In modern physics\n\nThe scientific climate of the twentieth century revived these questions. From about the time of Isaac Newton to that of James Clerk Maxwell they had been dormant, in the sense that the physical sciences could rely on the status of the real numbers as a description of the continuum, and an agnostic view of atoms and their structure. Quantum mechanics, the dominant physical theory after about 1925, was formulated in a way which raised questions of both types.\nIn the Newtonian framework there was indeed a degree of comfort in the answers one could give. Consider for example the question of whether the Earth really goes round the Sun. In a frame of reference adapted to calculating the Earth's orbit, this is a mathematical but also tautological statement. Newtonian mechanics can answer the question, whether it is not equally the case that the Sun goes round the Earth, as it indeed appears to Earth-based astronomers. In Newton's theory there is a basic, fixed frame of reference that is inertial. The 'correct answer' is that the point of view of an observer in an inertial frame of reference is privileged: other observers see artifacts of their acceleration relative to an inertial frame (the inertial forces). Before Newton, Galileo would draw the consequences, from the Copernican heliocentric model. He was, however, constrained to call his work (in effect) scientific formalism, under the old 'description' saving the phenomena. To avoid going against authority, the elliptic orbits of the heliocentric model could be labelled as a more convenient device for calculations, rather than an actual description of reality.\nIn general relativity, Newton's inertial frames are no longer privileged. In quantum mechanics, Paul Dirac argued that physical models were not there to provide semantic constructs allowing us to understand microscopic physics in language comparable to that we use on the familiar scale of everyday objects. His attitude, adopted by many theoretical physicists, is that a good model is judged by our capacity to use it to calculate physical quantities that can be tested experimentally. Dirac's view is close to what Bas van Fraassen calls constructive empiricism.\n", "## Duhem\n\nA physicist who took the issues involved seriously was Pierre Duhem, writing at the beginning of the twentieth century. He wrote an extended analysis of the approach he saw as characteristically British, in requiring field theories of theoretical physics to have a mechanical-physical interpretation. That was an accurate characterisation of what Dirac (himself British) would later argue against. The national characteristics specified by Duhem do not need to be taken too seriously, since he also claimed that the use of abstract algebra, namely quaternions, was also characteristically British (as opposed to French or German); as if the use of classical analysis methods alone was important one way or the other.\nDuhem also wrote on saving the phenomena. In addition to the Copernican Revolution debate of \"saving the phenomena\" (Greek: \u03c3\u1ff4\u03b6\u03b5\u03b9\u03bd \u03c4\u1f70 \u03c6\u03b1\u03b9\u03bd\u03cc\u03bc\u03b5\u03bd\u03b1, sozein ta phainomena) versus offering explanations that inspired Duhem was Thomas Aquinas, who wrote, regarding eccentrics and epicycles, that\n    Reason may be employed in two ways to establish a point: firstly, for the purpose of furnishing sufficient proof of some principle [...]. Reason is employed in another way, not as furnishing a sufficient proof of a principle, but as confirming an already established principle, by showing the congruity of its results, as in astronomy the theory of eccentrics and epicycles is considered as established, because thereby the sensible appearances of the heavenly movements can be explained (possunt salvari apparentia sensibilia); not, however, as if this proof were sufficient, forasmuch as some other theory might explain them. [...]\nThe idea that a physical interpretation\u2014in common language or classical ideas and physical entities, though of or examined in an ontological or quasi-ontological sense\u2014of a phenomenon in physics is not an ultimate or necessary condition for its understanding or validity, also appears in modern structural realist views on science.\n", "## Bellarmine\n\nRobert Bellarmine wrote to heliocentrist Paolo Antonio Foscarini:Nor is it the same to demonstrate that by assuming the sun to be at the center and the earth in heaven one can save the appearances, and to demonstrate that in truth the sun is at the center and the earth in heaven; for I believe the first demonstration may be available, but I have very great doubts about the second\u2026\nModern physicist Pierre Duhem \"suggests that in one respect, at least, Bellarmine had shown himself a better scientist than Galileo by disallowing the possibility of a 'strict proof of the earth's motion,' on the grounds that an astronomical theory merely 'saves the appearances' without necessarily revealing what 'really happens.'\"\n"]}
{"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Descriptive_research", "text_list": ["# Descriptive research\n\nDescriptive research is used to describe characteristics of a  population or phenomenon being studied. It does not answer questions about how/when/why the characteristics occurred.  Rather it addresses the \"what\" question (what are the characteristics of the population or situation being studied?). The characteristics used to describe the situation or population are usually some kind of categorical scheme also known as descriptive categories. For example, the periodic table categorizes the elements. Scientists use knowledge about the nature of electrons, protons and neutrons to devise this categorical scheme. We now take for granted the periodic table, yet it took descriptive research to devise it.  Descriptive research generally precedes explanatory research. For example, over time the periodic table's description of the elements allowed scientists to explain chemical reaction and make sound prediction when elements were combined.\nHence, descriptive research cannot describe what caused a situation.  Thus, descriptive research cannot be used as the basis of a causal relationship, where one variable affects another. In other words, descriptive research can be said to have a low requirement for internal validity.\nThe description is used for frequencies, averages, and other statistical calculations.  Often the best approach, prior to writing descriptive research, is to conduct a survey investigation. Qualitative research often has the aim of description and researchers may follow up with examinations of why the observations exist and what the implications of the findings are.\n", "## Social science research\n\nIn addition, the conceptualizing of descriptive research (categorization or taxonomy) precedes the hypotheses of explanatory research. (For a discussion of how the underlying conceptualization of exploratory research, descriptive research and explanatory research fit together, see: Conceptual framework.)\nDescriptive research can be statistical research. The main objective of this type of research is to describe the data and characteristics of what is being studied. The idea behind this type of research is to study frequencies, averages, and other statistical calculations. Although this research is highly accurate, it does not gather the causes behind a situation. Descriptive research is mainly done when a researcher wants to gain a better understanding of a topic. That is, analysis of the past as opposed to the future. Descriptive research is the exploration of the existing certain phenomena. The details of the facts won't be known. The existing phenomena's facts are not known to the person.\n", "## Descriptive science\n\nDescriptive science is a category of science that involves descriptive research; that is, observing, recording, describing, and classifying phenomena.  Descriptive research is sometimes contrasted with hypothesis-driven research, which is focused on testing a particular hypothesis by means of experimentation.\nDavid A. Grimaldi and Michael S. Engel suggest that descriptive science in biology is currently undervalued and misunderstood:\n    \"Descriptive\" in science is a pejorative, almost always preceded by \"merely,\" and typically applied to the array of classical -ologies and -omies: anatomy, archaeology, astronomy, embryology, morphology, paleontology, taxonomy, botany, cartography, stratigraphy, and the various disciplines of zoology, to name a few. [...] First, an organism, object, or substance is not described in a vacuum, but rather in comparison with other organisms, objects, and substances. [...] Second, descriptive science is not necessarily low-tech science, and high tech is not necessarily better. [...] Finally, a theory is only as good as what it explains and the evidence (i.e., descriptions) that supports it.\nA negative attitude by scientists toward descriptive science is not limited to biological disciplines: Lord Rutherford's notorious quote, \"All science is either physics or stamp collecting,\" displays a clear negative attitude about descriptive science, and it is known that he was dismissive of astronomy, which at the beginning of the 20th century was still gathering largely descriptive data about stars, nebulae, and galaxies, and was only beginning to develop a satisfactory integration of these observations within the framework of physical law, a cornerstone of the philosophy of physics.\n", "## Descriptive versus design sciences\n\nIlkka Niiniluoto has used the terms \"descriptive sciences\" and \"design sciences\" as an updated version of the distinction between basic and applied science.  According to Niiniluoto, descriptive sciences are those that seek to describe reality, while design sciences seek useful knowledge for human activities.\n"]}
{"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hard_and_soft_science", "text_list": ["# Hard and soft science\n\n\nHard science and soft science are colloquial terms used to compare scientific fields on the basis of perceived methodological rigor, exactitude, and objectivity. In general, the formal sciences and natural sciences are considered hard science, whereas the social sciences and other sciences are described as soft science.\nPrecise definitions vary, but features often cited as characteristic of hard science include producing testable predictions, performing controlled experiments, relying on quantifiable data and mathematical models, a high degree of accuracy and objectivity, higher levels of consensus, faster progression of the field, greater explanatory success, cumulativeness, replicability, and generally applying a purer form of the scientific method. A closely related idea (originating in the nineteenth century with Auguste Comte) is that scientific disciplines can be arranged into a hierarchy of hard to soft on the basis of factors such as rigor, \"development\", and whether they are basic or applied.\nPhilosophers and historians of science have questioned the relationship between these characteristics and perceived hardness or softness. The more \"developed\" hard sciences do not necessarily have a greater degree of consensus or selectivity in accepting new results. Commonly cited methodological differences are also not a reliable indicator. For example, social sciences such as psychology and sociology use mathematical models extensively, but are usually considered soft sciences. However, there are some measurable differences between hard and soft sciences. For example, hard sciences make more extensive use of graphs, and soft sciences are more prone to a rapid turnover of buzzwords.\nThe metaphor has been criticised for unduly stigmatizing soft sciences, creating an unwarranted imbalance in the public perception, funding, and recognition of different fields.\n", "## History of the terms\n\nThe origin of the terms \"hard science\" and \"soft science\" is obscure. The earliest attested use of \"hard science\" is found in an 1858 issue of the Journal of the Society of Arts, but the idea of a hierarchy of the sciences can be found earlier, in the work of the French philosopher Auguste Comte (1798\u20121857). He identified astronomy as the most general science, followed by physics, chemistry, biology, then sociology. This view was highly influential, and was intended to classify fields based on their degree of intellectual development and the complexity of their subject matter.\nThe modern distinction between hard and soft science is often attributed to a 1964 article published in Science by John R. Platt. He explored why he considered some scientific fields to be more productive than others, though he did not actually use the terms themselves. In 1967, sociologist of science Norman W. Storer specifically distinguished between the natural sciences as hard and the social sciences as soft. He defined hardness in terms of the degree to which a field uses mathematics and described a trend of scientific fields increasing in hardness over time, identifying features of increased hardness as including better integration and organization of knowledge, an improved ability to detect errors, and an increase in the difficulty of learning the subject.\n", "## Empirical support\n\nIn the 1970s sociologist Stephen Cole conducted a number of empirical studies attempting to find evidence for a hierarchy of scientific disciplines, and was unable to find significant differences in terms of core of knowledge, degree of codification, or research material. Differences that he did find evidence for included a tendency for textbooks in soft sciences to rely on more recent work, while the material in textbooks from the hard sciences was more consistent over time. After he published in 1983, it has been suggested that Cole might have missed some relationships in the data because he studied individual measurements, without accounting for the way multiple measurements could trend in the same direction, and because not all the criteria that could indicate a discipline's scientific status were analysed.\nIn 1984, Cleveland performed a survey of 57 journals and found that natural science journals used many more graphs than journals in mathematics or social science, and that social science journals often presented large amounts of observational data in the absence of graphs. The amount of page area used for graphs ranged from 0% to 31%, and the variation was primarily due to the number of graphs included rather than their sizes. Further analyses by Smith in 2000, based on samples of graphs from journals in seven major scientific disciplines, found that the amount of graph usage correlated \"almost perfectly\" with hardness (r=0.97). They also suggested that the hierarchy applies to individual fields, and demonstrated the same result using ten subfields of psychology (r=0.93).\nIn a 2010 article, Fanelli proposed that we expect more positive outcomes in \"softer\" sciences because there are fewer constraints on researcher bias. They found that among research papers that tested a hypothesis, the frequency of positive results was predicted by the perceived hardness of the field. For example, the social sciences as a whole had a 2.3-fold increased odds of positive results compared to the physical sciences, with the biological sciences in between. They added that this supported the idea that the social sciences and natural sciences differ only in degree, as long as the social sciences follow the scientific approach.\nIn 2013, Fanelli tested whether the ability of researchers in a field to \"achieve consensus and accumulate knowledge\" increases with the hardness of the science, and sampled 29,000 papers from 12 disciplines using measurements that indicate the degree of scholarly consensus. Out of the three possibilities (hierarchy, hard/soft distinction, or no ordering), the results supported a hierarchy, with physical sciences performing the best followed by biological sciences and then social sciences. The results also held within disciplines, as well as when mathematics and the humanities were included.\n", "## Criticism\n\nCritics of the concept argue that soft sciences are implicitly considered to be less \"legitimate\" scientific fields, or simply not scientific at all. An editorial in Nature stated that there is an opinion of social science findings being more likely to intersect with everyday experience and may be dismissed as \"obvious or insignificant\" as a result. Being labelled a soft science can affect the perceived value of a discipline to society and the amount of funding available to it. In the 1980s, mathematician Serge Lang successfully blocked influential political scientist Samuel P. Huntington's admission to the US National Academy of Sciences, describing Huntington's use of mathematics to quantify the relationship between factors such as \"social frustration\" (Lang asked Huntington if he possessed a \"social-frustration meter\") as \"pseudoscience\". During the late 2000s recessions, social science was disproportionately targeted for funding cuts compared to mathematics and natural science. Proposals were made for the United States' National Science Foundation to cease funding disciplines such as political science altogether. Both of these incidents prompted critical discussion of the distinction between hard and soft sciences.\nThe perception of hard vs soft science is influenced by gender bias with a higher proportion of women in a given field leading to a \"soft\" perception even within STEM fields. This perception of softness is accompanied by a devaluation of the field's worth.\n"]}
{"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-science", "text_list": ["# Non-science\n\nA non-science is an area of study that is not scientific, especially one that is not a natural science or a social science that is an object of scientific inquiry.  In this model, history, art, and religion are all examples of non-sciences.\n", "## Classifying knowledge\n\nSince the 17th century, some writers have used the word science to exclude some areas of studies, such as the arts and the liberal arts.  The word nonscience, to describe non-scientific academic disciplines, was first used in the middle of the 19th century.\nIn some cases, it can be difficult to identify exact boundaries between science and non-science.  The demarcation problem is the study of the difficulties in determining whether certain fields of study, near the boundaries of science and non-science, should be considered as one or the other.  No single test has yet been devised that can clearly separate science from non-science, but some factors, taken as a whole and evaluated over time, are commonly used.  In the view of Thomas Kuhn, these factors include the desire of scientists to investigate a question as if it were a puzzle.  Kuhn's view of science is also focused on the process of scientific inquiry, rather than the result.\nBoundary-work is the process of advocating for a desired outcome in the process of classifying fields of study that are near the borders.  The rewards associated with winning a particular classification suggest that the boundary between science and non-science is socially constructed and ideologically motivated rather than representing a stark natural difference between science and non-science.  The belief that scientific knowledge (e.g., biology) is more valuable than other forms of knowledge (e.g., ethics) is called scientism.\n", "## Areas of non-science\n\nNon-science includes all areas of study that are not science.  Non-science encompasses all of the humanities, including:\n  \u2022 history, including the history of science,\n  \u2022 the language arts, such as literature and language learning,\n  \u2022 philosophy, ethics, and religion, and\n  \u2022 art, including music, performing arts, fine arts, and crafts.\nThe philosopher Martin Mahner proposed calling these academic fields the parasciences, to distinguish them from disreputable forms of non-science, such as pseudoscience.\nNon-sciences offer information about the meaning of life, human values, the human condition, and ways of interacting with other people, including studies of cultures, morality and ethics.\n", "## Areas of disagreement\n\nPhilosophers disagree about whether areas of study involving abstract concepts, such as pure mathematics, are scientific or non-scientific.\nInterdisciplinary studies may cover knowledge-generating work that includes both scientific and non-scientific studies. Archaeology is an example of a field that borrows from both the natural sciences and history.\nFields of inquiry may change status over time.  For many centuries, alchemy was accepted as scientific:  it produced some useful information, and it supported experiments and open inquiry in the pursuit of understanding the physical world. Since the 20th century, it has been considered a pseudoscience.  Modern chemistry, which developed out of alchemy, is considered a major natural science.\n", "## Alternative systems\n\nSome philosophers, such as Paul Feyerabend, object to the effort to classify knowledge into science and non-science.  The distinction is artificial, as there is little or nothing that ties together all of the bodies of knowledge that are called \"sciences\".\nSome systems of organizing knowledge separate systematic knowledge from non-systematic methods of knowing or learning something, such as personal experiences, intuition, and innate knowledge. Wissenschaft is a broad concept that encompasses reliable knowledge without making a distinction between subject area.  The Wissenschaft concept is more useful than the distinction between science and non-science in distinguishing between knowledge and pseudo-knowledge, as the errors made in all forms of pseudo-scholarship, from pseudohistory to pseudoscience, are similar.  This Wissenschaft concept is used in the 2006 list of Fields of Science and Technology published by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, which defines \"science and technology\" as encompassing all humanistic disciplines, including religion and fine art.\n"]}
{"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normative_science", "text_list": ["# Normative science\n\nIn the applied sciences, normative science is a type of information that is developed, presented, or interpreted based on an assumed, usually unstated, preference for a particular outcome, policy or class of policies or outcomes.  Regular or traditional science does not presuppose a policy preference, but normative science, by definition, does.  Common examples of such policy preferences are arguments that pristine ecosystems are preferable to human altered ones, that native species are preferable to nonnative species, and that higher biodiversity is preferable to lower biodiversity.\nIn more general philosophical terms, normative science is a form of inquiry, typically involving a community of inquiry and its accumulated body of provisional knowledge, that seeks to discover good ways of achieving recognized aims, ends, goals, objectives, or purposes.  Many political debates revolve around arguments over which of the many \"good ways\" shall be selected.  For example, when presented as scientific information, words such as ecosystem health, biological integrity, and environmental degradation are typically examples of normative science because they each presuppose a policy preference and are therefore a type of policy advocacy.\n"]}
{"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protoscience", "text_list": ["# Protoscience\n\nIn the philosophy of science, protoscience is a research field that has the characteristics of an undeveloped science that may ultimately develop into an established science.  Philosophers use protoscience to understand the history of science and distinguish protoscience from science and pseudoscience.  The word roots proto- + science indicate first science.\n", "## History\n\nProtoscience as a research field with the characteristics of an undeveloped science appeared in the early 20th century. In 1910, Jones described economics:\n  I confess to a personal predilection for some term such as proto-science, pre-science, or nas-science, to give expression to what I conceive to be the true state of affairs, which I take to be this, that economics and kindred subjects are not sciences, but are on the way to become sciences.\nThomas Kuhn later provided a more precise description, protoscience as a field that generates testable conclusions, faces \"incessant criticism and continually strive for a fresh start\", but currently, like art and philosophy, appears to have failed to progress in a way similar to the progress seen in the established sciences.  He applies protoscience to the fields of natural philosophy, medicine and the crafts in the past that ultimately became established sciences.  Philosophers later developed more precise criteria to identify protoscience using the cognitive field concept.\n", "## Thought collective\n\nThis material is from Ludwik Fleck \u00a7 Thought collective\nThomas Kuhn later discovered that Fleck 1935 had voiced concepts that predated Kuhn's own work. That is, \nFleck wrote that the development of truth in scientific research was an unattainable ideal as different researchers were locked into thought collectives (or thought-styles). This means \"that a pure and direct observation cannot exist: in the act of perceiving objects the observer, i.e. the epistemological subject, is always influenced by the epoch and the environment to which he belongs, that is by what Fleck calls the thought style\". Thought style throughout Fleck's work is closely associated with representational style. A \"fact\" was a relative value, expressed in the language or symbolism of the thought collective in which it belonged, and subject to the social and temporal structure of this collective. He argued, however, that within the active cultural style of a thought collective, knowledge claims or facts were constrained by passive elements arising from the observations and experience of the natural world. This passive resistance of natural experience represented within the stylized means of the thought collective could be verified by anyone adhering to the culture of the thought collective, and thus facts could be agreed upon within any particular thought style. Thus while a fact may be verifiable within its own collective, it may be unverifiable in others. He felt that the development of scientific facts and concepts was not unidirectional and does not consist of just accumulating new pieces of information, but at times required changing older concepts, methods of observations, and forms of representation. This changing of prior knowledge is difficult because a collective attains over time a specific way of investigating, bringing with it a blindness to alternative ways of observing and conceptualization. Change was especially possible when members of two thought collectives met and cooperated in observing, formulating hypothesis and ideas. He strongly advocated comparative epistemology. He also notes some features of the culture of modern natural sciences that recognize provisionality and evolution of knowledge along the value of pursuit of passive resistances. This approach anticipated later developments in social constructionism, and especially the development of critical science and technology studies.\n", "## Conceptual framework\n\n### Cognitive field\nPhilosophers describe protoscience using the cognitive field concept.  In every society, there are fields of knowledge (cognitive fields).  The cognitive field consists of a community of individuals within a society with a domain of inquiry, a philosophical worldview, logical/mathematical tools, specific background knowledge from neighboring fields, a set of problems investigated, accumulated knowledge from the community, aims and methods.  Cognitive fields are either belief fields or research fields.  A cognitive research field invariably changes over time due to research; research fields include natural sciences, applied sciences, mathematics, technology, medicine, jurisprudence, social sciences and the humanities.  A belief field (faith field) is \"a cognitive field which either does not change at all or changes due to factors other than research (such as economic interest, political or religious pressure, or brute violence).\"  Belief fields include political ideology, religion, pseudodoctrines and pseudoscience.\n### Science field\nA science field is a research field that satisfies 12 conditions: i) all components of the science field invariably change over time from research in the field, especially logical/mathematical tools and specific background/presuppositions from other fields, ii) the research community has special training, \"hold strong information links\", initiates or continues the \"tradition of inquiry\" iii) researchers have autonomy to pursue research and receive support from the host society,  iv) the researchers worldview is the real world as contains \"lawfully changing concrete\" objects, an adequate view of the scientific method, a vision of organized science achieving truthfull descriptions and explanations, ethical principles for conducting research, and the free search for truthful, deep and systematic understanding, v) up-to-date logical/mathematical tools precisely determine and process information,   \nvi) the domain of research are real objects/entities, vii) specific background knowledge is up-to-date, confirmed data, hypotheses and theories from relevant neighboring fields, viii) the set of problems investigated are from the domain of inquiry or within the research field, ix) the accumulated knowledge includes worldview-compatible, up-to-date testworthy/testable theories, hypotheses and data, and special knowledge previously accumlated in the research field, x) the aims are find and apply laws and theories in the domain of inquiry, systemize acquired knonwledge, generalized information into theories, and improve research methods, xi) appropriate scientific methods are \"subject to test, correction and justification\", xii) the research field is connected with a wider research field with similar capable researchers capable of \"scientific inference, action and discussion\", similar hosting society, a domain of inquiry containing the domain of inquiry of the narrower field, and shared worldview, logical/mathematical tools, background knowledge, accumulated knowledge, aims and methods.\n### Protoscience\nPhilosophers define protoscience as an undeveloped science field, undeveloped meaning an incomplete or approximate science field.  Mario Bunge defined a protoscience as a research field that approximately satisfies a similar set of the 12 science conditions.  A protoscience that is evolving to ultimately satisfy all 12 conditions is an emerging or developing science.  Bunge states, \"The difference between protoscience and pseudoscience parallels that between error and deception.\" A protoscience may not survive or evolve to a science or pseudoscience.  Kuhn was skeptical about any remedy that would reliably transform a protoscience to a science stating, \"I claim no therapy to assist the transformation of a proto-science to a science, nor do I suppose anything of this sort is to be had.\"\nRaimo Tuomela defined a protoscience as a research field that satisfies 9 of the 12 science conditions; a protoscience fails to satisfy the up-to-date conditions for logic/mathematical tools, specific background knowledge from neighboring fields, and accumulated knowledge (v, vii, ix), and there is reason to believe the protoscience will ultimately satisfy all 12 conditions.  Protosciences and belief fields are both non-science fields, but only a protoscience can become a science field.  Tuomela emphasizes that the cognitive field concept refers to \"ideal types\" and there may be some persons within a science field with non-scientific \"attitudes, thinking and actions\"; therefore, it may be better to apply scientific and non-scientific to \"attitudes, thinking and actions\" rather than directly to cognitive fields.\n", "## Developmental stages of science\n\nBunge stated that protoscience may occur as the second stage of a five-stage process in the development of science.  Each stage has a theoretical and empirical aspect:\n  1. Prescience has unchecked speculation theory and unchecked data.\n  2. Protoscience has hypotheses without theory accompanied by observation and occasional measurement, but no experiment.\n  3. Deuteroscience has hypotheses formulated mathematically without theory accompanied by systematic measurement, and experiment on perceptible traits of perceptible objects.\n  4. Tritoscience has mathematical models accompanied by systematic measurements and experiments on perceptible and imperceptible traits of perceptible and imperceptible objects.\n  5. Tetartoscience has mathematical models and comprehensive theories accompanied by precise systematic measurements and experiments on perceptible and imperceptible traits of perceptible and imperceptible objects.\n", "## Origin of protoscience\n\nProtoscience may arise from the philosophical inquiry that anticipates science.  Philosophers anticipated the development of astronomy, atomic theory, evolution and linguistics.  The Greek philosopher Anaximander (610\u2013546 BC) viewed the earth as a non-moving free-floating cylinder in space.  The atomist doctrine of Democritus (460\u2013370 BC) to Epicurus (341\u2013270 BC) was that objects were composed of non-visible small particles.  Anaximander had anticipated that humans may have developed from more primitive organisms.  Wittgenstein\u2019s study of language preceded the linguistic studies of J. L. Austin and John Searle.  Popper describes how scientific theory arises from myths such as atomism and  the corpuscular theory of light.  Popper states that the Copernican system was \"inspired by a Neo-Platonic worship of the light of the Sun who had to occupy the center because of his nobility\", leading to \"testable components\" that ultimately became \"fruitful and important.\"\nSome scholars use the term \"primitive protoscience\" to describe ancient myths that help explain natural phenomena at a time prior to the development of the scientific method.\n", "## Protoscience examples\n\n### Physical science\n  \u2022 Ancient astronomical protoscience was recorded as astronomical images and records inscribed on stones, bones and cave walls.\n  \u2022 Luigi Ferdinando Marsili (1658\u20131730) contributed to protoscience oceanography, describing the ocean currents of the Bosporus and physical oceanography, and Benjamin Franklin contributed by identifying the currents of the Gulf Stream.\n  \u2022 Philosophers consider physics before Galileo and Huygens, chemistry before Lavoisier, medicine before Virchow and Bernard, electricity before the mid-eighteenth century, and the study of heredity and phylogeny before the mid-nineteenth century as protosciences that eventually became established science.\n  \u2022 Prior to 1905, leading scientists, Ostwald and Mach, viewed atomic and molecular-kinetic theory as a protoscience, a theory indirectly supported by chemistry and statistical thermodynamics; however, Einstein's theory of Brownian motion, and Perrin's experimental verification led to widespread acceptance of atomic and molecular-kinetic theory as established science.\n  \u2022 The early stage of plate tectonics, beginning with Wegener's theory of continental drift, was a protoscience until experimental research confirmed the theory many years later. The initial widespread rejection of Wegener's theory is an example of the importance of not dismissing a protoscience.\n### Psychology\nCritics state that psychology is a protoscience because some practices occur that prevent falsification of research hypotheses.  Folk psychology and coaching psychology are protosciences.\n### Medicine\nThe use of scientifically invalid biomarkers to identify adverse outcomes is a protoscience practice in medicine.  The process for reporting adverse medical events is a protoscience because it relies on uncorroborated data and unsystematic methods.\n### Technology\nHatleback describes cybersecurity as a protoscience that lacks transparency in experimentation,  scientific laws, and sound experimental design in some cases; however cybersecurity has the potential to become a science.\n"]}

He is often described as a polymath, and in mathematics as \"The Last Universalist\", since he excelled in all fields of the discipline as it existed during his lifetime. Due to his scientific success, influence and his discoveries, he has been deemed \"the philosopher par excellence of modern science.\"\nAs a mathematician and physicist, he made many original fundamental contributions to pure and applied mathematics, mathematical physics, and celestial mechanics. In his research on the three-body problem, Poincar\u00e9 became the first person to discover a chaotic deterministic system which laid the foundations of modern chaos theory. He is also considered to be one of the founders of the field of topology.\nPoincar\u00e9 made clear the importance of paying attention to the invariance of laws of physics under different transformations, and was the first to present the Lorentz transformations in their modern symmetrical form. Poincar\u00e9 discovered the remaining relativistic velocity transformations and recorded them in a letter to Hendrik Lorentz in 1905. Thus he obtained perfect invariance of all of Maxwell's equations, an important step in the formulation of the theory of special relativity. In 1905, Poincar\u00e9 first proposed gravitational waves (ondes gravifiques) emanating from a body and propagating at the speed of light as being required by the Lorentz transformations. In 1912, he wrote an influential paper which provided a mathematical argument for quantum mechanics.\nThe Poincar\u00e9 group used in physics and mathematics was named after him.\nEarly in the 20th century he formulated the Poincar\u00e9 conjecture, which became, over time, one of the famous unsolved problems in mathematics. It was solved in 2002\u20132003 by Grigori Perelman.\n", "## Life\n\nPoincar\u00e9 was born on 29 April 1854 in Cit\u00e9 Ducale neighborhood, Nancy, Meurthe-et-Moselle, into an influential French family. His father L\u00e9on Poincar\u00e9 (1828\u20131892) was a professor of medicine at the University of Nancy. His younger sister Aline married the spiritual philosopher \u00c9mile Boutroux. Another notable member of Henri's family was his cousin, Raymond Poincar\u00e9, a fellow member of the Acad\u00e9mie fran\u00e7aise, who was President of France from 1913 to 1920, and three-time Prime Minister of France between 1913 and 1929.\n### Education\nDuring his childhood he was seriously ill for a time with diphtheria and received special instruction from his mother, Eug\u00e9nie Launois (1830\u20131897).\nIn 1862, Henri entered the Lyc\u00e9e in Nancy (now renamed the Lyc\u00e9e Henri-Poincar\u00e9 in his honour, along with Henri Poincar\u00e9 University, also in Nancy). He spent eleven years at the Lyc\u00e9e and during this time he proved to be one of the top students in every topic he studied. He excelled in written composition. His mathematics teacher described him as a \"monster of mathematics\" and he won first prizes in the concours g\u00e9n\u00e9ral, a competition between the top pupils from all the Lyc\u00e9es across France. His poorest subjects were music and physical education, where he was described as \"average at best\". However, poor eyesight and a tendency towards absentmindedness may explain these difficulties. He graduated from the Lyc\u00e9e in 1871 with a baccalaur\u00e9at in both letters and sciences.\nDuring the Franco-Prussian War of 1870, he served alongside his father in the Ambulance Corps.\nPoincar\u00e9 entered the \u00c9cole Polytechnique as the top qualifier in 1873 and graduated in 1875. There he studied mathematics as a student of Charles Hermite, continuing to excel and publishing his first paper (D\u00e9monstration nouvelle des propri\u00e9t\u00e9s de l'indicatrice d'une surface) in 1874. From November 1875 to June 1878 he studied at the \u00c9cole des Mines, while continuing the study of mathematics in addition to the mining engineering syllabus, and received the degree of ordinary mining engineer in March 1879.\nAs a graduate of the \u00c9cole des Mines, he joined the Corps des Mines as an inspector for the Vesoul region in northeast France. He was on the scene of a mining disaster at Magny in August 1879 in which 18 miners died. He carried out the official investigation into the accident in a characteristically thorough and humane way.\nAt the same time, Poincar\u00e9 was preparing for his Doctorate in Science in mathematics under the supervision of Charles Hermite. His doctoral thesis was in the field of differential equations. It was named Sur les propri\u00e9t\u00e9s des fonctions d\u00e9finies par les \u00e9quations aux diff\u00e9rences partielles. Poincar\u00e9 devised a new way of studying the properties of these equations. He not only faced the question of determining the integral of such equations, but also was the first person to study their general geometric properties. He realised that they could be used to model the behaviour of multiple bodies in free motion within the Solar System. Poincar\u00e9 graduated from the University of Paris in 1879.\n### First scientific achievements\nAfter receiving his degree, Poincar\u00e9 began teaching as junior lecturer in mathematics at the University of Caen in Normandy (in December 1879). At the same time he published his first major article concerning the treatment of a class of automorphic functions.\nThere, in Caen, he met his future wife, Louise Poulain d'Andecy (1857\u20131934), granddaughter of Isidore Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire and great-granddaughter of \u00c9tienne Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire and on 20 April 1881, they married. Together they had four children: Jeanne (born 1887), Yvonne (born 1889), Henriette (born 1891), and L\u00e9on (born 1893).\nPoincar\u00e9 immediately established himself among the greatest mathematicians of Europe, attracting the attention of many prominent mathematicians. In 1881 Poincar\u00e9 was invited to take a teaching position at the Faculty of Sciences of the University of Paris; he accepted the invitation. During the years 1883 to 1897, he taught mathematical analysis in the \u00c9cole Polytechnique.\nIn 1881\u20131882, Poincar\u00e9 created a new branch of mathematics: qualitative theory of differential equations. He showed how it is possible to derive the most important information about the behavior of a family of solutions without having to solve the equation (since this may not always be possible). He successfully used this approach to problems in celestial mechanics and mathematical physics.\n### Career\nHe never fully abandoned his career in the mining administration to mathematics. He worked at the Ministry of Public Services as an engineer in charge of northern railway development from 1881 to 1885. He eventually became chief engineer of the Corps des Mines in 1893 and inspector general in 1910.\nBeginning in 1881 and for the rest of his career, he taught at the University of Paris (the Sorbonne). He was initially appointed as the ma\u00eetre de conf\u00e9rences d'analyse (associate professor of analysis). Eventually, he held the chairs of Physical and Experimental Mechanics, Mathematical Physics and Theory of Probability, and Celestial Mechanics and Astronomy.\nIn 1887, at the young age of 32, Poincar\u00e9 was elected to the French Academy of Sciences. He became its president in 1906, and was elected to the Acad\u00e9mie fran\u00e7aise on 5 March 1908.\nIn 1887, he won Oscar II, King of Sweden's mathematical competition for a resolution of the three-body problem concerning the free motion of multiple orbiting bodies. (See three-body problem section below.)\nIn 1893, Poincar\u00e9 joined the French Bureau des Longitudes, which engaged him in the synchronisation of time around the world. In 1897 Poincar\u00e9 backed an unsuccessful proposal for the decimalisation of circular measure, and hence time and longitude. It was this post which led him to consider the question of establishing international time zones and the synchronisation of time between bodies in relative motion. (See work on relativity section below.)\nIn 1904, he intervened in the trials of Alfred Dreyfus, attacking the spurious scientific claims regarding evidence brought against Dreyfus.\nPoincar\u00e9 was the President of the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Astronomique de France (SAF), the French astronomical society, from 1901 to 1903.\n#### Students\nPoincar\u00e9 had two notable doctoral students at the University of Paris, Louis Bachelier (1900) and Dimitrie Pompeiu (1905).\n### Death\nIn 1912, Poincar\u00e9 underwent surgery for a prostate problem and subsequently died from an embolism on 17 July 1912, in Paris. He was 58 years of age. He is buried in the Poincar\u00e9 family vault in the Cemetery of Montparnasse, Paris, in section 16 close to the gate Rue \u00c9mile-Richard.\n\nA former French Minister of Education, Claude All\u00e8gre, proposed in 2004 that Poincar\u00e9 be reburied in the Panth\u00e9on in Paris, which is reserved for French citizens of the highest honour.", "## Work\n\n### Summary\nPoincar\u00e9 made many contributions to different fields of pure and applied mathematics such as: celestial mechanics, fluid mechanics, optics, electricity, telegraphy, capillarity, elasticity, thermodynamics, potential theory, Quantum mechanics, theory of relativity and physical cosmology.\nHe was also a popularizer of mathematics and physics and wrote several books for the lay public.\nAmong the specific topics he contributed to are the following:\n  \u2022 algebraic topology (a field that Poincar\u00e9 virtually invented)\n  \u2022 the theory of analytic functions of several complex variables\n  \u2022 the theory of abelian functions\n  \u2022 algebraic geometry\n  \u2022 the Poincar\u00e9 conjecture, proven in 2003 by Grigori Perelman.\n  \u2022 Poincar\u00e9 recurrence theorem\n  \u2022 hyperbolic geometry\n  \u2022 number theory\n  \u2022 the three-body problem\n  \u2022 the theory of diophantine equations\n  \u2022 electromagnetism\n  \u2022 special relativity\n  \u2022 the fundamental group\n  \u2022 In the field of differential equations Poincar\u00e9 has given many results that are critical for the qualitative theory of differential equations, for example the Poincar\u00e9 sphere and the Poincar\u00e9 map.\n  \u2022 Poincar\u00e9 on \"everybody's belief\" in the Normal Law of Errors (see normal distribution for an account of that \"law\")\n  \u2022 Published an influential paper providing a novel mathematical argument in support of quantum mechanics.\n### Three-body problem\nThe problem of finding the general solution to the motion of more than two orbiting bodies in the Solar System had eluded mathematicians since Newton's time. This was known originally as the three-body problem and later the n-body problem, where n is any number of more than two orbiting bodies. The n-body solution was considered very important and challenging at the close of the 19th century. Indeed, in 1887, in honour of his 60th birthday, Oscar II, King of Sweden, advised by G\u00f6sta Mittag-Leffler, established a prize for anyone who could find the solution to the problem. The announcement was quite specific:\n    Given a system of arbitrarily many mass points that attract each according to Newton's law, under the assumption that no two points ever collide, try to find a representation of the coordinates of each point as a series in a variable that is some known function of time and for all of whose values the series converges uniformly.\nIn case the problem could not be solved, any other important contribution to classical mechanics would then be considered to be prizeworthy. The prize was finally awarded to Poincar\u00e9, even though he did not solve the original problem. One of the judges, the distinguished Karl Weierstrass, said, \"This work cannot indeed be considered as furnishing the complete solution of the question proposed, but that it is nevertheless of such importance that its publication will inaugurate a new era in the history of celestial mechanics.\" (The first version of his contribution even contained a serious error; for details see the article by Diacu and the book by Barrow-Green). The version finally printed contained many important ideas which led to the theory of chaos. The problem as stated originally was finally solved by Karl F. Sundman for n\u00a0=\u00a03 in 1912 and was generalised to the case of n\u00a0>\u00a03 bodies by Qiudong Wang in the 1990s. The series solutions have very slow convergence. It would take millions of terms to determine the motion of the particles for even very short intervals of time, so they are unusable in numerical work.\n### Work on relativity\n#### Local time\nPoincar\u00e9's work at the Bureau des Longitudes on establishing international time zones led him to consider how clocks at rest on the Earth, which would be moving at different speeds relative to absolute space (or the \"luminiferous aether\"), could be synchronised. At the same time Dutch theorist Hendrik Lorentz was developing Maxwell's theory into a theory of the motion of charged particles (\"electrons\" or \"ions\"), and their interaction with radiation. In 1895 Lorentz had introduced an auxiliary quantity (without physical interpretation) called \"local time\" $t^{\\prime }=t-vx/c^{2}\\,$ \nand introduced the hypothesis of length contraction to explain the failure of optical and electrical experiments to detect motion relative to the aether (see Michelson\u2013Morley experiment). Poincar\u00e9 was a constant interpreter (and sometimes friendly critic) of Lorentz's theory. Poincar\u00e9 as a philosopher was interested in the \"deeper meaning\". Thus he interpreted Lorentz's theory and in so doing he came up with many insights that are now associated with special relativity. In The Measure of Time (1898), Poincar\u00e9 said, \"A little reflection is sufficient to understand that all these affirmations have by themselves no meaning. They can have one only as the result of a convention.\" He also argued that scientists have to set the constancy of the speed of light as a postulate to give physical theories the simplest form.\nBased on these assumptions he discussed in 1900 Lorentz's \"wonderful invention\" of local time and remarked that it arose when moving clocks are synchronised by exchanging light signals assumed to travel with the same speed in both directions in a moving frame.\n#### Principle of relativity and Lorentz transformations\nIn 1881 Poincar\u00e9 described hyperbolic geometry in terms of the hyperboloid model, formulating transformations leaving invariant the Lorentz interval $x^{2}+y^{2}-z^{2}=-1$ , which makes them mathematically equivalent to the Lorentz transformations in 2+1 dimensions. In addition, Poincar\u00e9's other models of hyperbolic geometry (Poincar\u00e9 disk model, Poincar\u00e9 half-plane model) as well as the Beltrami\u2013Klein model can be related to the relativistic velocity space (see Gyrovector space).\nIn 1892 Poincar\u00e9 developed a mathematical theory of light including polarization. His vision of the action of polarizers and retarders, acting on a sphere representing polarized states, is called the Poincar\u00e9 sphere. It was shown that the Poincar\u00e9 sphere possesses an underlying Lorentzian symmetry, by which it can be used as a geometrical representation of Lorentz transformations and velocity additions.\nHe discussed the \"principle of relative motion\" in two papers in 1900\nand named it the principle of relativity in 1904, according to which no physical experiment can discriminate between a state of uniform motion and a state of rest.\nIn 1905 Poincar\u00e9 wrote to Lorentz about Lorentz's paper of 1904, which Poincar\u00e9 described as a \"paper of supreme importance\". In this letter he pointed out an error Lorentz had made when he had applied his transformation to one of Maxwell's equations, that for charge-occupied space, and also questioned the time dilation factor given by Lorentz.\nIn a second letter to Lorentz, Poincar\u00e9 gave his own reason why Lorentz's time dilation factor was indeed correct after all\u2014it was necessary to make the Lorentz transformation form a group\u2014and he gave what is now known as the relativistic velocity-addition law.\nPoincar\u00e9 later delivered a paper at the meeting of the Academy of Sciences in Paris on 5 June 1905 in which these issues were addressed. In the published version of that he wrote:\n    The essential point, established by Lorentz, is that the equations of the electromagnetic field are not altered by a certain transformation (which I will call by the name of Lorentz) of the form:\n$x^{\\prime }=k\\ell \\left(x+\\varepsilon t\\right)\\!,\\;t^{\\prime }=k\\ell \\left(t+\\varepsilon x\\right)\\!,\\;y^{\\prime }=\\ell y,\\;z^{\\prime }=\\ell z,\\;k=1/{\\sqrt {1-\\varepsilon ^{2}}}.$ \n\n\nand showed that the arbitrary function $\\ell \\left(\\varepsilon \\right)$  must be unity for all $\\varepsilon$  (Lorentz had set $\\ell =1$  by a different argument) to make the transformations form a group. In an enlarged version of the paper that appeared in 1906 Poincar\u00e9 pointed out that the combination $x^{2}+y^{2}+z^{2}-c^{2}t^{2}$  is invariant. He noted that a Lorentz transformation is merely a rotation in four-dimensional space about the origin by introducing $ct{\\sqrt {-1}}$  as a fourth imaginary coordinate, and he used an early form of four-vectors. Poincar\u00e9 expressed a lack of interest in a four-dimensional reformulation of his new mechanics in 1907, because in his opinion the translation of physics into the language of four-dimensional geometry would entail too much effort for limited profit. So it was Hermann Minkowski who worked out the consequences of this notion in 1907.\n#### Mass\u2013energy relation\nLike others before, Poincar\u00e9 (1900) discovered a relation between mass and electromagnetic energy. While studying the conflict between the action/reaction principle and Lorentz ether theory, he tried to determine whether the center of gravity still moves with a uniform velocity when electromagnetic fields are included. He noticed that the action/reaction principle does not hold for matter alone, but that the electromagnetic field has its own momentum. Poincar\u00e9 concluded that the electromagnetic field energy of an electromagnetic wave behaves like a fictitious fluid (fluide fictif) with a mass density of E/c^2. If the center of mass frame is defined by both the mass of matter and the mass of the fictitious fluid, and if the fictitious fluid is indestructible\u2014it's neither created or destroyed\u2014then the motion of the center of mass frame remains uniform. But electromagnetic energy can be converted into other forms of energy. So Poincar\u00e9 assumed that there exists a non-electric energy fluid at each point of space, into which electromagnetic energy can be transformed and which also carries a mass proportional to the energy. In this way, the motion of the center of mass remains uniform. Poincar\u00e9 said that one should not be too surprised by these assumptions, since they are only mathematical fictions.\nHowever, Poincar\u00e9's resolution led to a paradox when changing frames: if a Hertzian oscillator radiates in a certain direction, it will suffer a recoil from the inertia of the fictitious fluid. Poincar\u00e9 performed a Lorentz boost (to order v/c) to the frame of the moving source. He noted that energy conservation holds in both frames, but that the law of conservation of momentum is violated. This would allow perpetual motion, a notion which he abhorred. The laws of nature would have to be different in the frames of reference, and the relativity principle would not hold. Therefore, he argued that also in this case there has to be another compensating mechanism in the ether.\nPoincar\u00e9 himself came back to this topic in his St. Louis lecture (1904). He rejected the possibility that energy carries mass and criticized his own solution to compensate the above-mentioned problems:\n    The apparatus will recoil as if it were a cannon and the projected energy a ball, and that contradicts the principle of Newton, since our present projectile has no mass; it is not matter, it is energy. [..] Shall we say that the space which separates the oscillator from the receiver and which the disturbance must traverse in passing from one to the other, is not empty, but is filled not only with ether, but with air, or even in inter-planetary space with some subtile, yet ponderable fluid; that this matter receives the shock, as does the receiver, at the moment the energy reaches it, and recoils, when the disturbance leaves it? That would save Newton's principle, but it is not true. If the energy during its propagation remained always attached to some material substratum, this matter would carry the light along with it and Fizeau has shown, at least for the air, that there is nothing of the kind. Michelson and Morley have since confirmed this. We might also suppose that the motions of matter proper were exactly compensated by those of the ether; but that would lead us to the same considerations as those made a moment ago. The principle, if thus interpreted, could explain anything, since whatever the visible motions we could imagine hypothetical motions to compensate them. But if it can explain anything, it will allow us to foretell nothing; it will not allow us to choose between the various possible hypotheses, since it explains everything in advance. It therefore becomes useless. \nIn the above quote he refers to the Hertz assumption of total aether entrainment that was falsified by the Fizeau experiment but that experiment does indeed show that that light is partially \"carried along\" with a substance. Finally in 1908 he revisits the problem and ends with abandoning the principle of reaction altogether in favor of supporting a solution based in the inertia of aether itself.\n    But we have seen above that Fizeau's experiment does not permit of our retaining the theory of Hertz; it is necessary therefore to adopt the theory of Lorentz, and consequently to renounce the principle of reaction. \nHe also discussed two other unexplained effects: (1) non-conservation of mass implied by Lorentz's variable mass $\\gamma m$ , Abraham's theory of variable mass and Kaufmann's experiments on the mass of fast moving electrons and (2) the non-conservation of energy in the radium experiments of Marie Curie.\nIt was Albert Einstein's concept of mass\u2013energy equivalence (1905) that a body losing energy as radiation or heat was losing mass of amount m\u00a0=\u00a0E/c^2 that resolved Poincar\u00e9's paradox, without using any compensating mechanism within the ether. The Hertzian oscillator loses mass in the emission process, and momentum is conserved in any frame. However, concerning Poincar\u00e9's solution of the Center of Gravity problem, Einstein noted that Poincar\u00e9's formulation and his own from 1906 were mathematically equivalent.\n#### Gravitational waves\nIn 1905 Poincar\u00e9 first proposed gravitational waves (ondes gravifiques) emanating from a body and propagating at the speed of light.  He wrote:\n    It has become important to examine this hypothesis more closely and in particular to ask in what ways it would require us to modify the laws of gravitation.  That is what I have tried to determine;  at first I was led to assume that the propagation of gravitation is not instantaneous, but happens with the speed of light.\n#### Poincar\u00e9 and Einstein\nEinstein's first paper on relativity was published three months after Poincar\u00e9's short paper, but before Poincar\u00e9's longer version. Einstein relied on the principle of relativity to derive the Lorentz transformations and used a similar clock synchronisation procedure (Einstein synchronisation) to the one that Poincar\u00e9 (1900) had described, but Einstein's paper was remarkable in that it contained no references at all. Poincar\u00e9 never acknowledged Einstein's work on special relativity. However, Einstein expressed sympathy with Poincar\u00e9's outlook obliquely in a letter to Hans Vaihinger on 3 May 1919, when Einstein considered Vaihinger's general outlook to be close to his own and Poincar\u00e9's to be close to Vaihinger's. In public, Einstein acknowledged Poincar\u00e9 posthumously in the text of a lecture in 1921 titled \"Geometrie und Erfahrung (Geometry and Experience)\" in connection with non-Euclidean geometry, but not in connection with special relativity. A few years before his death, Einstein commented on Poincar\u00e9 as being one of the pioneers of relativity, saying \"Lorentz had already recognized that the transformation named after him is essential for the analysis of Maxwell's equations, and Poincar\u00e9 deepened this insight still further ....\".\n#### Assessments on Poincar\u00e9 and relativity\nPoincar\u00e9's work in the development of special relativity is well recognised, though most historians stress that despite many similarities with Einstein's work, the two had very different research agendas and interpretations of the work. Poincar\u00e9 developed a similar physical interpretation of local time and noticed the connection to signal velocity, but contrary to Einstein he continued to use the ether-concept in his papers and argued that clocks at rest in the ether show the \"true\" time, and moving clocks show the local time. So Poincar\u00e9 tried to keep the relativity principle in accordance with classical concepts, while Einstein developed a mathematically equivalent kinematics based on the new physical concepts of the relativity of space and time.\nWhile this is the view of most historians, a minority go much further, such as E. T. Whittaker, who held that Poincar\u00e9 and Lorentz were the true discoverers of relativity.\n### Algebra and number theory\nPoincar\u00e9 introduced group theory to physics, and was the first to study the group of Lorentz transformations. He also made major contributions to the theory of discrete groups and their representations.\n### Topology\nThe subject is clearly defined by Felix Klein in his \"Erlangen Program\" (1872): the geometry invariants of arbitrary continuous transformation, a kind of geometry. The term \"topology\" was introduced, as suggested by Johann Benedict Listing, instead of previously used \"Analysis situs\". Some important concepts were introduced by Enrico Betti and Bernhard Riemann. But the foundation of this science, for a space of any dimension, was created by Poincar\u00e9. His first article on this topic appeared in 1894.\nHis research in geometry led to the abstract topological definition of homotopy and homology. He also first introduced the basic concepts and invariants of combinatorial topology, such as Betti numbers and the fundamental group. Poincar\u00e9 proved a formula relating the number of edges, vertices and faces of n-dimensional polyhedron (the Euler\u2013Poincar\u00e9 theorem) and gave the first precise formulation of the intuitive notion of dimension.\n### Astronomy and celestial mechanics\nPoincar\u00e9 published two now classical monographs, \"New Methods of Celestial Mechanics\" (1892\u20131899) and \"Lectures on Celestial Mechanics\" (1905\u20131910). In them, he successfully applied the results of their research to the problem of the motion of three bodies and studied in detail the behavior of solutions (frequency, stability, asymptotic, and so on). They introduced the small parameter method, fixed points, integral invariants, variational equations, the convergence of the asymptotic expansions. Generalizing a theory of Bruns (1887), Poincar\u00e9 showed that the three-body problem is not integrable. In other words, the general solution of the three-body problem can not be expressed in terms of algebraic and transcendental functions through unambiguous coordinates and velocities of the bodies. His work in this area was the first major achievement in celestial mechanics since Isaac Newton.\nThese monographs include an idea of Poincar\u00e9, which later became the basis for mathematical \"chaos theory\" (see, in particular, the Poincar\u00e9 recurrence theorem) and the general theory of dynamical systems.\nPoincar\u00e9 authored important works on astronomy for the equilibrium figures of a gravitating rotating fluid. He introduced the important concept of bifurcation points and proved the existence of equilibrium figures such as the non-ellipsoids, including ring-shaped and pear-shaped figures, and their stability. For this discovery, Poincar\u00e9 received the Gold Medal of the Royal Astronomical Society (1900).\n### Differential equations and mathematical physics\nAfter defending his doctoral thesis on the study of singular points of the system of differential equations, Poincar\u00e9 wrote a series of memoirs under the title \"On curves defined by differential equations\" (1881\u20131882). In these articles, he built a new branch of mathematics, called \"qualitative theory of differential equations\". Poincar\u00e9 showed that even if the differential equation can not be solved in terms of known functions, yet from the very form of the equation, a wealth of information about the properties and behavior of the solutions can be found. In particular, Poincar\u00e9 investigated the nature of the trajectories of the integral curves in the plane, gave a classification of singular points (saddle, focus, center, node), introduced the concept of a limit cycle and the loop index, and showed that the number of limit cycles is always finite, except for some special cases. Poincar\u00e9 also developed a general theory of integral invariants and solutions of the variational equations. For the finite-difference equations, he created a new direction \u2013 the asymptotic analysis of the solutions. He applied all these achievements to study practical problems of mathematical physics and celestial mechanics, and the methods used were the basis of its topological works.\n", "## Character\n\nPoincar\u00e9's work habits have been compared to a bee flying from flower to flower. Poincar\u00e9 was interested in the way his mind worked; he studied his habits and gave a talk about his observations in 1908 at the Institute of General Psychology in Paris. He linked his way of thinking to how he made several discoveries.\nThe mathematician Darboux claimed he was un intuitif (an intuitive), arguing that this is demonstrated by the fact that he worked so often by visual representation. Jacques Hadamard wrote that Poincar\u00e9's research demonstrated marvelous clarity and Poincar\u00e9 himself wrote that he  believed that logic was not a way to invent but a way to structure ideas and that logic limits ideas.\n### Toulouse's characterisation\nPoincar\u00e9's mental organisation was interesting not only to Poincar\u00e9 himself but also to \u00c9douard Toulouse, a psychologist of the Psychology Laboratory of the School of Higher Studies in Paris. Toulouse wrote a book entitled Henri Poincar\u00e9 (1910). In it, he discussed Poincar\u00e9's regular schedule:\n  \u2022 He worked during the same times each day in short periods of time. He undertook mathematical research for four hours a day, between 10\u00a0a.m. and noon then again from 5\u00a0p.m. to 7\u00a0p.m.. He would read articles in journals later in the evening.\n  \u2022 His normal work habit was to solve a problem completely in his head, then commit the completed problem to paper.\n  \u2022 He was ambidextrous and nearsighted.\n  \u2022 His ability to visualise what he heard proved particularly useful when he attended lectures, since his eyesight was so poor that he could not see properly what the lecturer wrote on the blackboard.\nThese abilities were offset to some extent by his shortcomings:\n  \u2022 He was physically clumsy and artistically inept.\n  \u2022 He was always in a rush and disliked going back for changes or corrections.\n  \u2022 He never spent a long time on a problem since he believed that the subconscious would continue working on the problem while he consciously worked on another problem.\nIn addition, Toulouse stated that most mathematicians worked from principles already established while Poincar\u00e9 started from basic principles each time (O'Connor et al., 2002).\nHis method of thinking is well summarised as:\n    Habitu\u00e9 \u00e0 n\u00e9gliger les d\u00e9tails et \u00e0 ne regarder que les cimes, il passait de l'une \u00e0 l'autre avec une promptitude surprenante et les faits qu'il d\u00e9couvrait se groupant d'eux-m\u00eames autour de leur centre \u00e9taient instantan\u00e9ment et automatiquement class\u00e9s dans sa m\u00e9moire (accustomed to neglecting details and to looking only at mountain tops, he went from one peak to another with surprising rapidity, and the facts he discovered, clustering around their center, were instantly and automatically pigeonholed in his memory).\u2014\u200aBelliver (1956)\n", "## Publications\n\n\n  \u2022 Le\u00e7ons sur la th\u00e9orie math\u00e9matique de la lumi\u00e8re (in French).

The nomination archive reveals that Poincar\u00e9 received a total of 51 nominations between 1904 and 1912, the year of his death. Of the 58 nominations for the 1910 Nobel Prize, 34 named Poincar\u00e9. Nominators included Nobel laureates Hendrik Lorentz and Pieter Zeeman (both of 1902), Marie Curie (of 1903), Albert Michelson (of 1907), Gabriel Lippmann (of 1908) and Guglielmo Marconi (of 1909).\nThe fact that renowned theoretical physicists like Poincar\u00e9, Boltzmann or Gibbs were not awarded the Nobel Prize is seen as evidence that the Nobel committee had more regard for experimentation than theory. In Poincar\u00e9's case, several of those who nominated him pointed out that the greatest problem was to name a specific discovery, invention, or technique.\n", "## Philosophy\n\nPoincar\u00e9 had philosophical views opposite to those of Bertrand Russell and Gottlob Frege, who believed that mathematics was a branch of logic. Poincar\u00e9 strongly disagreed, claiming that intuition was the life of mathematics. Poincar\u00e9 gives an interesting point of view in his 1902 book Science and Hypothesis:\n    For a superficial observer, scientific truth is beyond the possibility of doubt; the logic of science is infallible, and if the scientists are sometimes mistaken, this is only from their mistaking its rule.\nPoincar\u00e9 believed that arithmetic is synthetic. He argued that Peano's axioms cannot be proven non-circularly with the principle of induction (Murzi, 1998), therefore concluding that arithmetic is a priori synthetic and not analytic. Poincar\u00e9 then went on to say that mathematics cannot be deduced from logic since it is not analytic. His views were similar to those of Immanuel Kant (Kolak, 2001, Folina 1992). He strongly opposed Cantorian set theory, objecting to its use of impredicative definitions.\nHowever, Poincar\u00e9 did not share Kantian views in all branches of philosophy and mathematics. For example, in geometry, Poincar\u00e9 believed that the structure of non-Euclidean space can be known analytically. Poincar\u00e9 held that convention plays an important role in physics. His view (and some later, more extreme versions of it) came to be known as \"conventionalism\". Poincar\u00e9 believed that Newton's first law was not empirical but is a conventional framework assumption for mechanics (Gargani, 2012). He also believed that the geometry of physical space is conventional. He considered examples in which either the geometry of the physical fields or gradients of temperature can be changed, either describing a space as non-Euclidean measured by rigid rulers, or as a Euclidean space where the rulers are expanded or shrunk by a variable heat distribution. However, Poincar\u00e9 thought that we were so accustomed to Euclidean geometry that we would prefer to change the physical laws to save Euclidean geometry rather than shift to non-Euclidean physical geometry.\n### Free will\nPoincar\u00e9's famous lectures before the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de Psychologie in Paris (published as Science and Hypothesis, The Value of Science, and Science and Method) were cited by Jacques Hadamard as the source for the idea that creativity and invention consist of two mental stages, first random combinations of possible solutions to a problem, followed by a critical evaluation.\nAlthough he most often spoke of a deterministic universe, Poincar\u00e9 said that the subconscious generation of new possibilities involves chance.\n    \n    It is certain that the combinations which present themselves to the mind in a kind of sudden illumination after a somewhat prolonged period of unconscious work are generally useful and fruitful combinations... all the combinations are formed as a result of the automatic action of the subliminal ego, but those only which are interesting find their way into the field of consciousness... A few only are harmonious, and consequently at once useful and beautiful, and they will be capable of affecting the geometrician's special sensibility I have been speaking of; which, once aroused, will direct our attention upon them, and will thus give them the opportunity of becoming conscious... In the subliminal ego, on the contrary, there reigns what I would call liberty, if one could give this name to the mere absence of discipline and to disorder born of chance.\n    \n\nPoincar\u00e9's two stages\u2014random combinations followed by selection\u2014became the basis for Daniel Dennett's two-stage model of free will.\n", "## Bibliography\n\n### Poincar\u00e9's writings in English translation\nPopular writings on the philosophy of science:\n  \u2022 Poincar\u00e9, Henri (1902\u20131908), The Foundations of Science, New York: Science Press; reprinted in 1921; this book includes the English translations of Science and Hypothesis (1902), The Value of Science (1905), Science and Method (1908).\n  \u2022 1905. \"Science and Hypothesis\", The Walter Scott Publishing Co.\n  \u2022 1906. \"The End of Matter\", Athen\u00e6um\n  \u2022 1913. \"The New Mechanics\", The Monist, Vol. XXIII.\n  \u2022 1913. \"The Relativity of Space\", The Monist, Vol. XXIII.\n  \u2022 1913.

{"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rudolf_Steiner", "text_list": ["# Rudolf Steiner\n\nRudolf Joseph Lorenz Steiner (27 or 25 February 1861 \u2013 30 March 1925) was an Austrian occultist, social reformer, architect, esotericist, and claimed clairvoyant. Steiner gained initial recognition at the end of the nineteenth century as a literary critic and published works including The Philosophy of Freedom. At the beginning of the twentieth century he founded an esoteric spiritual movement, anthroposophy, with roots in German idealist philosophy and theosophy. His teachings are influenced by Christian Gnosticism or neognosticism. Many of his ideas are pseudoscientific. He was also prone to pseudohistory.\nIn the first, more philosophically oriented phase of this movement, Steiner attempted to find a synthesis between science and spirituality. His philosophical work of these years, which he termed \"spiritual science\", sought to apply what he saw as the clarity of thinking characteristic of Western philosophy to spiritual questions, differentiating this approach from what he considered to be vaguer approaches to mysticism. In a second phase, beginning around 1907, he began working collaboratively in a variety of artistic media, including drama, dance and architecture, culminating in the building of the Goetheanum, a cultural centre to house all the arts. In the third phase of his work, beginning after World War I, Steiner worked on various ostensibly applied projects, including Waldorf education, biodynamic agriculture, and anthroposophical medicine.\nSteiner advocated a form of ethical individualism, to which he later brought a more explicitly spiritual approach. He based his epistemology on Johann Wolfgang Goethe's world view in which \"thinking\u2026is no more and no less an organ of perception than the eye or ear. Just as the eye perceives colours and the ear sounds, so thinking perceives ideas.\" A consistent thread that runs through his work is the goal of demonstrating that there are no limits to human knowledge.\n", "## Biography\n\n### Childhood and education\nSteiner's father, Johann(es) Steiner (1829\u20131910), left a position as a gamekeeper in the service of Count Hoyos in Geras, northeast Lower Austria to marry one of the Hoyos family's housemaids, Franziska Blie (1834 Horn \u2013 1918, Horn), a marriage for which the Count had refused his permission. Johann became a telegraph operator on the Southern Austrian Railway, and at the time of Rudolf's birth was stationed in Murakir\u00e1ly (Kraljevec) in the Murak\u00f6z region of the Kingdom of Hungary, Austrian Empire (present-day Donji Kraljevec in the Me\u0111imurje region of northernmost Croatia). In the first two years of Rudolf's life, the family moved twice, first to M\u00f6dling, near Vienna, and then, through the promotion of his father to stationmaster, to Pottschach, located in the foothills of the eastern Austrian Alps in Lower Austria.\nSteiner entered the village school, but following a disagreement between his father and the schoolmaster, he was briefly educated at home. In 1869, when Steiner was eight years old, the family moved to the village of Neud\u00f6rfl and in October 1872 Steiner proceeded from the village school there to the realschule in Wiener Neustadt.\nIn 1879, the family moved to Inzersdorf to enable Steiner to attend the Vienna Institute of Technology, where he enrolled in courses in mathematics, physics, chemistry, botany, zoology, and mineralogy and audited courses in literature and philosophy, on an academic scholarship from 1879 to 1883, where he completed his studies and the requirements of the Ghega scholarship satisfactorily. In 1882, one of Steiner's teachers, Karl Julius Schr\u00f6er, suggested Steiner's name to Joseph K\u00fcrschner, chief editor of a new edition of Goethe's works, who asked Steiner to become the edition's natural science editor, a truly astonishing opportunity for a young student without any form of academic credentials or previous publications. In fact, it was a low-paid and boring job, according to Steiner himself.\nBefore attending the Vienna Institute of Technology, Steiner had studied Kant, Fichte and Schelling.\n### Early spiritual experiences\nWhen he was nine years old, Steiner believed that he saw the spirit of an aunt who had died in a far-off town, asking him to help her at a time when neither he nor his family knew of the woman's death. Steiner later related that as a child, he felt \"that one must carry the knowledge of the spiritual world within oneself after the fashion of geometry ... [for here] one is permitted to know something which the mind alone, through its own power, experiences. In this feeling I found the justification for the spiritual world that I experienced ... I confirmed for myself by means of geometry the feeling that I must speak of a world 'which is not seen'.\"\nSteiner believed that at the age of 15 he had gained a complete understanding of the concept of time, which he considered to be the precondition of spiritual clairvoyance. At 21, on the train between his home village and Vienna, Steiner met a herb gatherer, Felix Kogutzki, who spoke about the spiritual world \"as one who had his own experience therein\".\n### Writer and philosopher\nThe young Steiner emerged as an individualist, positivist and freethinker, who was not afraid to refer to scandalous philosophers such as Stirner, Nietzsche and Haeckel. His freethinking culminated in a contempt for religion and faith. He attributed almost pathological traits to Christianity. \nIn 1888, as a result of his work for the K\u00fcrschner edition of Goethe's works, Steiner was invited to work as an editor at the Goethe archives in Weimar. Steiner remained with the archive until 1896. It was a low-paid and boring job. As well as the introductions for and commentaries to four volumes of Goethe's scientific writings, Steiner wrote two books about Goethe's philosophy: The Theory of Knowledge Implicit in Goethe's World-Conception (1886), which Steiner regarded as the epistemological foundation and justification for his later work, and Goethe's Conception of the World (1897). During this time he also collaborated in complete editions of the works of Arthur Schopenhauer and the writer Jean Paul and wrote numerous articles for various journals.\nIn 1891, Steiner received a doctorate in philosophy at the University of Rostock, for his dissertation discussing \nFichte's concept of the ego, submitted to Heinrich von Stein, whose Seven Books of Platonism Steiner esteemed. Steiner's dissertation was later published in expanded form as Truth and Knowledge: Prelude to a Philosophy of Freedom, with a dedication to Eduard von Hartmann. Two years later, in 1894, he published Die Philosophie der Freiheit (The Philosophy of Freedom or The Philosophy of Spiritual Activity, the latter being Steiner's preferred English title), an exploration of epistemology and ethics that suggested a way for humans to become spiritually free beings. Steiner hoped that the book \"would gain him a professorship\", but the book was not well received. Steiner later spoke of this book as containing implicitly, in philosophical form, the entire content of what he later developed explicitly as anthroposophy.\nIn 1896, Steiner declined an offer from Elisabeth F\u00f6rster-Nietzsche to help organize the Nietzsche archive in Naumburg. Her brother, Friedrich Nietzsche, was by that time non compos mentis. \"Hoping for a job (which, in fact, he did not get), Steiner accepted the invitation immediately.\" F\u00f6rster-Nietzsche introduced Steiner into the presence of the catatonic philosopher; Steiner, deeply moved, subsequently wrote the book Friedrich Nietzsche, Fighter for Freedom. Steiner later related that:\n    My first acquaintance with Nietzsche's writings belongs to the year 1889. Previous to that I had never read a line of his. Upon the substance of my ideas as these find expression in The Philosophy of Spiritual Activity, Nietzsche's thought had not the least influence....Nietzsche's ideas of the 'eternal recurrence' and of '\u00dcbermensch' remained long in my mind. For in these was reflected that which a personality must feel concerning the evolution and essential being of humanity when this personality is kept back from grasping the spiritual world by the restricted thought in the philosophy of nature characterizing the end of the 19th century....What attracted me particularly was that one could read Nietzsche without coming upon anything which strove to make the reader a 'dependent' of Nietzsche's.\nIn 1897, Steiner left the Weimar archives and moved to Berlin. He became part owner of, chief editor of, and an active contributor to the literary journal Magazin f\u00fcr Literatur, where he hoped to find a readership sympathetic to his philosophy. Many subscribers were alienated by Steiner's unpopular support of \u00c9mile Zola in the Dreyfus Affair and the journal lost more subscribers when Steiner published extracts from his correspondence with anarchist John Henry Mackay. Dissatisfaction with his editorial style eventually led to his departure from the magazine. In 1899, Steiner married Anna Eunicke; the couple separated several years later. Anna died in 1911.\nDespite his fame as a teacher of esotericism, Steiner was culturally and academically isolated.\n    Worse, he couldn't be a real philosopher either; his theosophy and anthroposophy and the Waldorf humanism in particular were considered pseudoscience or at best pedagogy, not a philosophical system. Steiner's credentials were not university-level professional work. [...] German mainstream scholarship called him an 'autodidact, with a poor teacher' and 'gypsy-intellectual.'^144 Not uncommon for practitioners at the fringes of society, he was accused of class treason.\u2014\u200aThorsten J. Pattberg\n### Theosophical Society\nIn 1899, Steiner published an article, \"Goethe's Secret Revelation\", discussing the esoteric nature of Goethe's fairy tale The Green Snake and the Beautiful Lily. This article led to an invitation by the Count and Countess Brockdorff to speak to a gathering of Theosophists on the subject of Nietzsche. Steiner continued speaking regularly to the members of the Theosophical Society, becoming the head of its newly constituted German section in 1902 without ever formally joining the society. It was also in connection with this society that Steiner met and worked with Marie von Sivers, who became his second wife in 1914. By 1904, Steiner was appointed by Annie Besant to be leader of the Theosophical Esoteric Society for Germany and Austria. In 1904, Eliza, the wife of Helmuth von Moltke the Younger, became one of his favourite scholars. Through Eliza, Steiner met Helmuth, who served as the Chief of the German General Staff from 1906 to 1914.\nIn contrast to mainstream Theosophy, Steiner sought to build a Western approach to spirituality based on the philosophical and mystical traditions of European culture. The German Section of the Theosophical Society grew rapidly under Steiner's leadership as he lectured throughout much of Europe on his spiritual science. During this period, Steiner maintained an original approach, replacing Madame Blavatsky's terminology with his own, and basing his spiritual research and teachings upon the Western esoteric and philosophical tradition. This and other differences, in particular Steiner's vocal rejection of Leadbeater and Besant's claim that Jiddu Krishnamurti was the vehicle of a new Maitreya, or world teacher, led to a formal split in 1912\u201313, when Steiner and the majority of members of the German section of the Theosophical Society broke off to form a new group, the Anthroposophical Society. Steiner took the name \"Anthroposophy\" from the title of a work of the Austrian philosopher Robert von Zimmermann, published in Vienna in 1856. Despite his departure from the Theosophical Society, Steiner maintained his interest in Theosophy throughout his life.\nAccording to Helmut Zander, Steiner's clairvoyant insights always developed according to the same pattern. He took revised texts from theosophical literature and then passed them off as his own higher insights. Because he did not want to be an occult storyteller, but a (spiritual) scientist, he adapted his reading, which he had seen supernaturally in the world's memory, to the current state of technology. When, for example, the Wright brothers began flying with gliders and eventually with motorized aircraft in 1903, Steiner transformed the ponderous gondola airships of his Atlantis story into airplanes with elevators and rudders in 1904.\n### Anthroposophical Society and its cultural activities\nThe Anthroposophical Society grew rapidly. Fueled by a need to find an artistic home for their yearly conferences, which included performances of plays written by Edouard Schur\u00e9 and Steiner, the decision was made to build a theater and organizational center. In 1913, construction began on the first Goetheanum building, in Dornach, Switzerland. The building, designed by Steiner, was built to a significant part by volunteers. Steiner moved from Berlin to Dornach in 1913 and lived there to the end of his life.\nSteiner's lecture activity expanded enormously with the end of the war. Most importantly, from 1919 on Steiner began to work with other members of the society to found numerous practical institutions and activities, including the first Waldorf school, founded that year in Stuttgart, Germany. On New Year's Eve, 1922\u20131923, the Goetheanum burned to the ground; contemporary police reports indicate arson as the probable cause. Steiner immediately began work designing a second Goetheanum building - this time made of concrete instead of wood - which was completed in 1928, three years after his death.\nAt a \"Foundation Meeting\" for members held at the Dornach center during Christmas 1923, Steiner founded the School of Spiritual Science. This school, which was led by Steiner, initially had sections for general anthroposophy, education, medicine, performing arts (eurythmy, speech, drama and music), the literary arts and humanities, mathematics, astronomy, science, and visual arts. Later sections were added for the social sciences, youth and agriculture. The School of Spiritual Science included meditative exercises given by Steiner.\n### Political engagement and social agenda\nSteiner became a well-known and controversial public figure during and after World War I. In response to the catastrophic situation in post-war Germany, he proposed extensive social reforms through the establishment of a Threefold Social Order in which the cultural, political and economic realms would be largely independent. Steiner argued that a fusion of the three realms had created the inflexibility that had led to catastrophes such as World War I. In connection with this, he promoted a radical solution in the disputed area of Upper Silesia, claimed by both Poland and Germany. His suggestion that this area be granted at least provisional independence led to his being publicly accused of being a traitor to Germany.\nSteiner opposed Wilson's proposal to create new European nations based around ethnic groups, which he saw as opening the door to rampant nationalism. Steiner proposed, as an alternative:\n    'social territories' with democratic institutions that were accessible to all inhabitants of a territory whatever their origin while the needs of the various ethnicities would be met by independent cultural institutions.\n### Attacks, illness, and death\nThe National Socialist German Workers Party gained strength in Germany after the First World War. In 1919, a political theorist of this movement, Dietrich Eckart, attacked Steiner and suggested that he was a Jew. In 1921, Adolf Hitler attacked Steiner on many fronts, including accusations that he was a tool of the Jews. That same year, Steiner warned against the disastrous effects it would have for Central Europe if the National Socialists came to power. In 1922 a lecture Steiner was giving in Munich was disrupted when stink bombs were let off and the lights switched out, while people rushed the stage apparently attempting to attack Steiner, who exited safely through a back door. Unable to guarantee his safety, Steiner's agents cancelled his next lecture tour. The 1923 Beer Hall Putsch in Munich led Steiner to give up his residence in Berlin, saying that if those responsible for the attempted coup (Hitler's Nazi party) came to power in Germany, it would no longer be possible for him to enter the country.\nFrom 1923 on, Steiner showed signs of increasing frailness and illness. He nonetheless continued to lecture widely, and even to travel; especially towards the end of this time, he was often giving two, three or even four lectures daily for courses taking place concurrently. Many of these lectures focused on practical areas of life such as education.\nIncreasingly ill, he held his last lecture in late September, 1924. He continued work on his autobiography during the last months of his life; he died at Dornach on 30 March 1925.\n### Spiritual research\nSteiner first began speaking publicly about spiritual experiences and phenomena in his 1899 lectures to the Theosophical Society. By 1901 he had begun to write about spiritual topics, initially in the form of discussions of historical figures such as the mystics of the Middle Ages. By 1904 he was expressing his own understanding of these themes in his essays and books, while continuing to refer to a wide variety of historical sources.\n    A world of spiritual perception is discussed in a number of writings which I have published since this book appeared. The Philosophy of Freedom forms the philosophical basis for these later writings. For it tries to show that the experience of thinking, rightly understood, is in fact an experience of spirit.\n    (Steiner, Philosophy of Freedom, Consequences of Monism)\nSteiner aimed to apply his training in mathematics, science, and philosophy to produce rigorous, verifiable presentations of those experiences. He believed that through freely chosen ethical disciplines and meditative training, anyone could develop the ability to experience the spiritual world, including the higher nature of oneself and others. Steiner believed that such discipline and training would help a person to become a more moral, creative and free individual \u2013 free in the sense of being capable of actions motivated solely by love. His philosophical ideas were affected by Franz Brentano, with whom he had studied, as well as by Fichte, Hegel, Schelling, and Goethe's phenomenological approach to science.\nSteiner used the word Geisteswissenschaft (from Geist = mind or spirit, Wissenschaft = science), a term originally coined by Wilhelm Dilthey as a descriptor of the humanities, in a novel way, to describe a systematic (\"scientific\") approach to spirituality. Steiner used the term Geisteswissenschaft, generally translated into English as \"spiritual science,\" to describe a discipline treating the spirit as something actual and real, starting from the premise that it is possible for human beings to penetrate behind what is sense-perceptible. He proposed that psychology, history, and the humanities generally were based on the direct grasp of an ideal reality, and required close attention to the particular period and culture which provided the distinctive character of religious qualities in the course of the evolution of consciousness. In contrast to William James' pragmatic approach to religious and psychic experience, which emphasized its idiosyncratic character, Steiner focused on ways such experience can be rendered more intelligible and integrated into human life.\nSteiner proposed that an understanding of reincarnation and karma was necessary to understand psychology and that the form of external nature would be more comprehensible as a result of insight into the course of karma in the evolution of humanity. Beginning in 1910, he described aspects of karma relating to health, natural phenomena and free will, taking the position that a person is not bound by his or her karma, but can transcend this through actively taking hold of one's own nature and destiny. In an extensive series of lectures from February to September 1924, Steiner presented further research on successive reincarnations of various individuals and described the techniques he used for karma research.\n", "## Breadth of activity\n\nAfter the First World War, Steiner became active in a wide variety of cultural contexts. He founded a number of schools, the first of which was known as the Waldorf school, which later evolved into a worldwide school network. He also founded a system of organic agriculture, now known as biodynamic agriculture, which was one of the first forms of modern organic farming. His work in medicine is based in pseudoscience and occult ideas. Even though his medical ideas led to the development of a broad range of complementary medications and supportive artistic and biographic therapies, they are considered ineffective by the medical community. Numerous homes for children and adults with developmental disabilities based on his work (including those of the Camphill movement) are found in Africa, Europe, and North America. His paintings and drawings influenced Joseph Beuys and other modern artists. His two Goetheanum buildings are considered significant examples of modern architecture, and other anthroposophical architects have contributed thousands of buildings to the modern scene.\nSteiner's literary estate is broad. Steiner's writings, published in about forty volumes, include books, essays, four plays ('mystery dramas'), mantric verse, and an autobiography. His collected lectures, making up another approximately 300 volumes, discuss a wide range of themes. Steiner's drawings, chiefly illustrations done on blackboards during his lectures, are collected in a separate series of 28 volumes. Many publications have covered his architectural legacy and sculptural work.\n### Education\nAs a young man, Steiner was a private tutor and a lecturer on history for the Berlin Arbeiterbildungsschule, an educational initiative for working class adults. Soon thereafter, he began to articulate his ideas on education in public lectures, culminating in a 1907 essay on The Education of the Child in which he described the major phases of child development which formed the foundation of his approach to education. His conception of education was influenced by the Herbartian pedagogy prominent in Europe during the late nineteenth century, though Steiner criticized Herbart for not sufficiently recognizing the importance of educating the will and feelings as well as the intellect.\nIn 1919, Emil Molt invited him to lecture to his workers at the Waldorf-Astoria cigarette factory in Stuttgart. Out of these lectures came the first Waldorf School. In 1922, Steiner presented these ideas at a conference called for this purpose in Oxford by Professor Millicent Mackenzie. He subsequently presented a teacher training course at Torquay in 1924 at an Anthroposophy Summer School organised by Eleanor Merry. The Oxford Conference and the Torquay teacher training led to the founding of the first Waldorf schools in Britain. During Steiner's lifetime, schools based on his educational principles were also founded in Hamburg, Essen, The Hague and London; there are now more than 1000 Waldorf schools worldwide.\n### Biodynamic agriculture\nIn 1924, a group of farmers concerned about the future of agriculture requested Steiner's help. Steiner responded with a lecture series on an ecological and sustainable approach to agriculture that increased soil fertility without the use of chemical fertilizers and pesticides. Steiner's agricultural ideas promptly spread and were put into practice internationally and biodynamic agriculture is now practiced in Europe, North America, South America, Africa, Asia and Australasia.\n\"Steiner\u2019s 'biodynamic agriculture' based on 'restoring the quasi-mystical relationship between earth and the cosmos' was widely accepted in the Third Reich (28).\"\nA central aspect of biodynamics is that the farm as a whole is seen as an organism, and therefore should be a largely self-sustaining system, producing its own manure and animal feed. Plant or animal disease is seen as a symptom of problems in the whole organism. Steiner also suggested timing such agricultural activities as sowing, weeding, and harvesting to utilize the influences on plant growth of the moon and planets; and the application of natural materials prepared in specific ways to the soil, compost, and crops, with the intention of engaging non-physical beings and elemental forces. He encouraged his listeners to verify such suggestions empirically, as he had not yet done.\nIn a 2002 newspaper editorial, Peter Treue, agricultural researcher at the University of Kiel, characterized biodynamics as pseudoscience and argued that similar or equal results can be obtained using standard organic farming principles. He wrote that some biodynamic preparations more resemble alchemy or magic akin to geomancy.\n### Anthroposophical medicine\nFrom the late 1910s, Steiner was working with doctors to create a new approach to medicine. In 1921, pharmacists and physicians gathered under Steiner's guidance to create a pharmaceutical company called Weleda which now distributes naturopathic medical and beauty products worldwide. At around the same time, Dr. Ita Wegman founded a first anthroposophic medical clinic (now the Ita Wegman Clinic) in Arlesheim. Anthroposophic medicine is practiced in some 80 countries. It is a form of alternative medicine based on pseudoscientific and occult notions.\n### Social reform\nFor a period after World War I, Steiner was active as a lecturer on social reform. A petition expressing his basic social ideas was widely circulated and signed by many cultural figures of the day, including Hermann Hesse.\nIn Steiner's chief book on social reform, Toward Social Renewal, he suggested that the cultural, political and economic spheres of society need to work together as consciously cooperating yet independent entities, each with a particular task: political institutions should be democratic, establish political equality and protect human rights; cultural institutions should nurture the free and unhindered development of science, art, education and religion; and economic institutions should enable producers, distributors, and consumers to cooperate voluntarily to provide efficiently for society's needs. He saw this division of responsibility as a vital task which would take up consciously the historical trend toward the mutual independence of these three realms. Steiner also gave suggestions for many specific social reforms.\nSteiner proposed that societal well-being fundamentally depends upon a relationship of mutuality between the individuals and the community as a whole:\n    The well-being of a community of people working together will be the greater, the less the individual claims for himself the proceeds of his work, i.e. the more of these proceeds he makes over to his fellow-workers, the more his own needs are satisfied, not out of his own work but out of the work done by others.\u2014\u200aSteiner, The Fundamental Social Law\nHe expressed another aspect of this in the following motto:\n    The healthy social life is found When in the mirror of each human soul The whole community finds its reflection, And when in the community  The virtue of each one is living.\u2014\u200aSteiner, The Fundamental Social Law\nAccording to Cees Leijenhorst, \"Steiner outlined his vision of a new political and social philosophy that avoids the two extremes of capitalism and socialism.\"\nAccording to Egil Asprem, \"Steiner\u2019s teachings had a clear authoritarian ring, and developed a rather crass polemic against 'materialism', 'liberalism', and cultural 'degeneration'. [...] For example, anthroposophical medicine was developed to contrast with the 'materialistic' (and hence 'degenerate') medicine of the establishment.\"\n### Architecture and visual arts\nSteiner designed 17 buildings, including the First and Second Goetheanums. These two buildings, built in Dornach, Switzerland, were intended to house significant theater spaces as well as a \"school for spiritual science\". Three of Steiner's buildings have been listed amongst the most significant works of modern architecture.\nHis primary sculptural work is The Representative of Humanity (1922), a nine-meter high wood sculpture executed as a joint project with the sculptor Edith Maryon. This was intended to be placed in the first Goetheanum. It shows a central human figure, the \"Representative of Humanity,\" holding a balance between opposing tendencies of expansion and contraction personified as the beings of Lucifer and Ahriman. It was intended to show, in conscious contrast to Michelangelo's Last Judgment, Christ as mute and impersonal such that the beings that approach him must judge themselves. The sculpture is now on permanent display at the Goetheanum.\nSteiner's blackboard drawings were unique at the time and almost certainly not originally intended as art works. Joseph Beuys' work, itself heavily influenced by Steiner, has led to the modern understanding of Steiner's drawings as artistic objects.\n### Performing arts\nSteiner wrote four mystery plays between 1909 and 1913: The Portal of Initiation, The Souls' Probation, The Guardian of the Threshold and The Soul's Awakening, modeled on the esoteric dramas of Edouard Schur\u00e9, Maurice Maeterlinck, and Johann Wolfgang von Goethe. Steiner's plays continue to be performed by anthroposophical groups in various countries, most notably (in the original German) in Dornach, Switzerland and (in English translation) in Spring Valley, New York and in Stroud and Stourbridge in the U.K.\nIn collaboration with Marie von Sivers, Steiner also founded a new approach to acting, storytelling, and the recitation of poetry. His last public lecture course, given in 1924, was on speech and drama. The Russian actor, director, and acting coach Michael Chekhov based significant aspects of his method of acting on Steiner's work.\nTogether with Marie von Sivers, Rudolf Steiner also developed the art of eurythmy, sometimes referred to as \"visible speech and song\". According to the principles of eurythmy, there are archetypal movements or gestures that correspond to every aspect of speech \u2013 the sounds (or phonemes), the rhythms, and the grammatical function \u2013 to every \"soul quality\" \u2013 joy, despair, tenderness, etc. \u2013 and to every aspect of music \u2013 tones, intervals, rhythms, and harmonies.\n### Esoteric schools\nSteiner was founder and leader of the following: \n  \u2022 His independent Esoteric School of the Theosophical Society, founded in 1904. This school continued after the break with Theosophy but was disbanded at the start of World War I.\n  \u2022 A lodge called Mystica Aeterna within the Masonic Order of Memphis and Mizraim, which Steiner led from 1906 until around 1914. Steiner added to the Masonic rite a number of Rosicrucian references.\n  \u2022 The School of Spiritual Science of the Anthroposophical Society, founded in 1923 as a further development of his earlier Esoteric School. This was originally constituted with a general section and seven specialized sections for education, literature, performing arts, natural sciences, medicine, visual arts, and astronomy. Steiner gave members of the School the first Lesson for guidance into the esoteric work in February 1924. Though Steiner intended to develop three \"classes\" of this school, only the first of these was developed in his lifetime (and continues today). An authentic text of the written records on which the teaching of the First Class was based was published in 1992.\n", "## Philosophical ideas\n\n### Goethean science\nIn his commentaries on Goethe's scientific works, written between 1884 and 1897, Steiner presented Goethe's approach to science as essentially phenomenological in nature, rather than theory or model-based. He developed this conception further in several books, The Theory of Knowledge Implicit in Goethe's World-Conception (1886) and Goethe's Conception of the World (1897), particularly emphasizing the transformation in Goethe's approach from the physical sciences, where experiment played the primary role, to plant biology, where both accurate perception and imagination were required to find the biological archetypes (Urpflanze). He postulated that Goethe had sought, but been unable to fully find, the further transformation in scientific thinking necessary to properly interpret and understand the animal kingdom. Steiner emphasized the role of evolutionary thinking in Goethe's discovery of the intermaxillary bone in human beings; Goethe expected human anatomy to be an evolutionary transformation of animal anatomy. Steiner defended Goethe's qualitative description of color as arising synthetically from the polarity of light and darkness, in contrast to Newton's particle-based and analytic conception.\n    Particular organic forms can be evolved only from universal types, and every organic entity we experience must coincide with some one of these derivative forms of the type. Here the evolutionary method must replace the method of proof. We aim not to show that external conditions act upon one another in a certain way and thereby bring about a definite result, but that a particular form has developed under definite external conditions out of the type. This is the radical difference between inorganic and organic science.\u2014\u200aRudolf Steiner, The Theory of Knowledge Implicit in Goethe's World Conception, Chapter XVI, \"Organic Nature\"\nA variety of authors have termed Goethean science pseudoscience. According to Dan Dugan, Steiner was a champion of the following pseudoscientific claims:\n  1. Goethe's Theory of Colours;\n  2. \"he called relativity 'brilliant nonsense'\";\n  3. \"he taught that the motions of the planets were caused by the relationships of the spiritual beings that inhabited them\";\n  4. vitalism;\n  5. doubting germ theory;\n  6. non-standard approach to physiological systems, including claiming that the heart is not a pump.\nAccording to Rudolf Steiner, mainstream science is Ahrimanic.\n### Knowledge and freedom\nSteiner approached the philosophical questions of knowledge and freedom in two stages. In his dissertation, published in expanded form in 1892 as Truth and Knowledge, Steiner suggests that there is an inconsistency between Kant's philosophy, which posits that all knowledge is a representation of an essential verity inaccessible to human consciousness, and modern science, which assumes that all influences can be found in the sensory and mental world to which we have access. Steiner considered Kant's philosophy of an inaccessible beyond (\"Jenseits-Philosophy\") a stumbling block in achieving a satisfying philosophical viewpoint.\nSteiner postulates that the world is essentially an indivisible unity, but that our consciousness divides it into the sense-perceptible appearance, on the one hand, and the formal nature accessible to our thinking, on the other. He sees in thinking itself an element that can be strengthened and deepened sufficiently to penetrate all that our senses do not reveal to us. Steiner thus considered what appears to human experience as a division between the spiritual and natural worlds to be a conditioned result of the structure of our consciousness, which separates perception and thinking. These two faculties give us not two worlds, but two complementary views of the same world; neither has primacy and the two together are necessary and sufficient to arrive at a complete understanding of the world. In thinking about perception (the path of natural science) and perceiving the process of thinking (the path of spiritual training), it is possible to discover a hidden inner unity between the two poles of our experience. Truth, for Steiner, is paradoxically both an objective discovery and yet \"a free creation of the human spirit, that never would exist at all if we did not generate it ourselves. The task of understanding is not to replicate in conceptual form something that already exists, but rather to create a wholly new realm, that together with the world given to our senses constitutes the fullness of reality.\"\nIn The Philosophy of Freedom, Steiner further explores potentials within thinking: freedom, he suggests, can only be approached gradually with the aid of the creative activity of thinking. Thinking can be a free deed; in addition, it can liberate our will from its subservience to our instincts and drives. Free deeds, he suggests, are those for which we are fully conscious of the motive for our action; freedom is the spiritual activity of penetrating with consciousness our own nature and that of the world, and the real activity of acting in full consciousness. This includes overcoming influences of both heredity and environment: \"To be free is to be capable of thinking one's own thoughts \u2013 not the thoughts merely of the body, or of society, but thoughts generated by one's deepest, most original, most essential and spiritual self, one's individuality.\"\nSteiner affirms Darwin's and Haeckel's evolutionary perspectives but extended this beyond its materialistic consequences; he sees human consciousness, indeed, all human culture, as a product of natural evolution that transcends itself. For Steiner, nature becomes self-conscious in the human being. Steiner's description of the nature of human consciousness thus closely parallels that of Solovyov.\n\"Steiner was a moral individualist\".\n### Spiritual science\nIn his earliest works, Steiner already spoke of the \"natural and spiritual worlds\" as a unity. From 1900 on, he began lecturing about concrete details of the spiritual world(s), culminating in the publication in 1904 of the first of several systematic presentations, his Theosophy: An Introduction to the Spiritual Processes in Human Life and in the Cosmos. As a starting point for the book Steiner took a quotation from Goethe, describing the method of natural scientific observation, while in the Preface he made clear that the line of thought taken in this book led to the same goal as that in his earlier work, The Philosophy of Freedom.\nIn the years 1903\u20131908 Steiner maintained the magazine Lucifer-Gnosis and published in it essays on topics such as initiation, reincarnation and karma, and knowledge of the supernatural world. Some of these were later collected and published as books, such as How to Know Higher Worlds (1904\u20135) and Cosmic Memory. The book An Outline of Esoteric Science was published in 1910. Important themes include:\n  \u2022 the human being as body, soul and spirit;\n  \u2022 the path of spiritual development;\n  \u2022 spiritual influences on world-evolution and history; and\n  \u2022 reincarnation and karma.\nSteiner emphasized that there is an objective natural and spiritual world that can be known, and that perceptions of the spiritual world and incorporeal beings are, under conditions of training comparable to that required for the natural sciences, including self-discipline, replicable by multiple observers. It is on this basis that spiritual science is possible, with radically different epistemological foundations than those of natural science. He believed that natural science was correct in its methods but one-sided for exclusively focusing on sensory phenomena, while mysticism was vague in its methods, though seeking to explore the inner and spiritual life. Anthroposophy was meant to apply the systematic methods of the former to the content of the latter\nFor Steiner, the cosmos is permeated and continually transformed by the creative activity of non-physical processes and spiritual beings. For the human being to become conscious of the objective reality of these processes and beings, it is necessary to creatively enact and reenact, within, their creative activity. Thus objective spiritual knowledge always entails creative inner activity. Steiner articulated three stages of any creative deed:\n  \u2022 Moral intuition: the ability to discover or, preferably, develop valid ethical principles;\n  \u2022 Moral imagination: the imaginative transformation of such principles into a concrete intention applicable to the particular situation (situational ethics); and\n  \u2022 Moral technique: the realization of the intended transformation, depending on a mastery of practical skills.\nSteiner termed his work from this period onwards Anthroposophy. He emphasized that the spiritual path he articulated builds upon and supports individual freedom and independent judgment; for the results of spiritual research to be appropriately presented in a modern context they must be in a form accessible to logical understanding, so that those who do not have access to the spiritual experiences underlying anthroposophical research can make independent evaluations of the latter's results. Spiritual training is to support what Steiner considered the overall purpose of human evolution, the development of the mutually interdependent qualities of love and freedom.\n### Steiner and Christianity\nSteiner appreciated the ritual of the mass he experienced while serving as an altar boy from school age until he was ten years old, and this experience remained memorable for him as a genuinely spiritual one, contrasting with his irreligious family life. As a young adult, Steiner had no formal connection to organized religion. In 1899, he experienced what he described as a life-transforming inner encounter with the being of Christ. Steiner was then 38, and the experience of meeting Christ occurred after a tremendous inner struggle. To use Steiner's own words, the \"experience culminated in my standing in the spiritual presence of the Mystery of Golgotha in a most profound and solemn festival of knowledge.\" His relationship to Christianity thereafter remained entirely founded upon personal experience, and thus both non-denominational and strikingly different from conventional religious forms.\n#### Christ and human evolution\nSteiner describes Christ as the unique pivot and meaning of earth's evolutionary processes and human history, redeeming the Fall from Paradise. He understood the Christ as a being that unifies and inspires all religions, not belonging to a particular religious faith. To be \"Christian\" is, for Steiner, a search for balance between polarizing extremes and the ability to manifest love in freedom.\nCentral principles of his understanding include:\n  \u2022 The being of Christ is central to all religions, though called by different names by each.\n  \u2022 Every religion is valid and true for the time and cultural context in which it was born.\n  \u2022 Historical forms of Christianity need to be transformed in our times in order to meet the ongoing evolution of humanity.\nIn Steiner's esoteric cosmology, the spiritual development of humanity is interwoven in and inseparable from the cosmological development of the universe. Continuing the evolution that led to humanity being born out of the natural world, the Christ being brings an impulse enabling human consciousness of the forces that act creatively, but unconsciously, in nature.\n#### Divergence from conventional Christian thought\nSteiner's views of Christianity diverge from conventional Christian thought in key places, and include gnostic elements. However, unlike many gnostics, Steiner affirms the unique and actual physical Incarnation of Christ in Jesus at the beginning of the Christian era.\nOne of the central points of divergence with conventional Christian thought is found in Steiner's views on reincarnation and karma.\nSteiner also posited two different Jesus children involved in the Incarnation of the Christ: one child descended from Solomon, as described in the Gospel of Matthew; the other child from Nathan, as described in the Gospel of Luke. He references in this regard the fact that the genealogies in these two gospels list twenty-six (Luke) to forty-one (Matthew) completely different ancestors for the generations from David to Jesus.\nSteiner's view of the second coming of Christ is also unusual. He suggested that this would not be a physical reappearance, but rather, meant that the Christ being would become manifest in non-physical form, in the \"etheric realm\" \u2013 i.e. visible to spiritual vision and apparent in community life \u2013 for increasing numbers of people, beginning around the year 1933. He emphasized that the future would require humanity to recognize this Spirit of Love in all its genuine forms, regardless of how this is named. He also warned that the traditional name, \"Christ\", might be used, yet the true essence of this Being of Love be ignored.\nThe teachings of Anthroposophy got called Christian Gnosticism. Indeed, according to the official stance of the Catholic Church, Anthroposophy is \"a neognostic heresy\". Other heresiologists agree. The Lutheran (Missouri Sinod) apologist and heresiologist Eldon K. Winker quoted Ron Rhodes that Steiner had the same Christology as Cerinthus. Indeed, Steiner thought that Jesus and Christ were two separated beings, who got fused at a certain point in time, which can be construed as Gnostic but not as Docetic, since \"they do not believe the Christ departed from Jesus prior to the crucfixion\". \"Steiner's Christology is discussed as a central element of his thought in Johannes Hemleben, Rudolf Steiner: A Documentary Biography, trans. Leo Twyman (East Grinstead, Sussex: Henry Goulden, 1975), pp. 96-100. From the perspective of orthodox Christianity, it may be said that Steiner combined a docetic understanding of Christ's nature with the Adoptionist heresy.\" Older scholarship says Steiner's Christology is Nestorian. According to Egil Asprem, \"Steiner\u2019s Christology was, however, quite heterodox, and hardly compatible with official church doctrine.\"\nTwo German scholars have called Anthroposophy \"the most successful form of 'alternative' religion in the [twentieth] century.\" Other scholars stated that Anthroposophy is \"aspiring to the status of religious dogma\". According to Maria Carlson, anthroposophy is a \"positivistic religion\" \"offering a seemingly logical theology based on pseudoscience.\"\nAccording to Swartz, Brandt, Hammer, and Hansson, Anthroposophy is a religion. They also call it \"settled new religious movement\", while Martin Gardner called it a cult. Another scholar also calls it a new religious movement or a new spiritual movement. Already in 1924 Anthroposophy got labeled \"new religious movement\" and \"occultist movement\". Other scholars agree it is a new religious movement. According to Helmut Zander, both the theory and practice of Anthroposophy display characteristics of religion, and, according to Zander, Rudolf Steiner would plead no contest. According to Zander, Steiner's book Geheimwissenschaft [Occult Science] contains Steiner's mythology about cosmogenesis. Hammer notices that Anthroposophy is a synthesis which does include occultism. Hammer also notices that Steiner's occult doctrines bear a strong resemblance to post-Blavatskyan Theosophy (e.g. Annie Besant and Charles Webster Leadbeater).\nRobert A. McDermott says Anthroposophy belongs to Christian Rosicrucianism. According to Nicholas Goodrick-Clarke, Rudolf Steiner \"blended modern Theosophy with a Gnostic form of Christianity, Rosicrucianism, and German Naturphilosophie\".\nGeoffrey Ahern states that Anthroposophy belongs to neo-gnosticism broadly conceived, which he identifies with Western esotericism and occultism.\n    Was Steiner a Gnostic? Yes and no. Yes, from the point of view that he offered insights and methods for a personal experience of Christ. I have formulated this aspect of his work as his hermeneutical key: \u2018not I, but Christ in me\u2019. No, from the point of view that he was not trying to reestablish Gnosticism's practices into a neo-gnostic tradition. Steiner was, in his times, well aware of concerns articulated more recently by Pope Francis about the two subtle enemies of holiness, contemporary Gnosticism and contemporary Pelagianism.\u2014\u200aSamson 2023, p.\u00a0180\n    Granted that Steiner included Gnostic elements in his cosmological reinterpretation of Christianity, many of them from the Pistis Sophia, Steiner was not a Gnostic in the sense of someone who held that the world was ruled by a demiurge, that matter was evil, or that it was possible to escape from this fallen universe by acquiring secret spiritual knowledge. To characterize the structure of his thought as derived from Syrio-Egyptian gnosis (Ahern 2010) may be too strong and plays down the fact that he was critical of early Gnostic Christianity as having no adequate idea of Jesus as a man of flesh and blood.\u2014\u200aHudson 2019, p.\u00a0510\nAccording to Catholic scholars Anthroposophy belongs to the New Age.\n#### The Christian Community\nIn the 1920s, Steiner was approached by Friedrich Rittelmeyer, a Lutheran pastor with a congregation in Berlin, who asked if it was possible to create a more modern form of Christianity. Soon others joined Rittelmeyer \u2013 mostly Protestant pastors and theology students, but including several Roman Catholic priests. Steiner offered counsel on renewing the spiritual potency of the sacraments while emphasizing freedom of thought and a personal relationship to religious life. He envisioned a new synthesis of Catholic and Protestant approaches to religious life, terming this \"modern, Johannine Christianity\".\nThe resulting movement for religious renewal became known as \"The Christian Community\". Its work is based on a free relationship to Christ without dogma or policies. Its priesthood, which is open to both men and women, is free to preach out of their own spiritual insights and creativity.\nSteiner emphasized that the resulting movement for the renewal of Christianity was a personal gesture of help to a movement founded by Rittelmeyer and others independently of his anthroposophical work. The distinction was important to Steiner because he sought with Anthroposophy to create a scientific, not faith-based, spirituality. He recognized that for those who wished to find more traditional forms, however, a renewal of the traditional religions was also a vital need of the times.\n", "## Reception\n\nSteiner's work has influenced a broad range of notable personalities. These include:\n  \u2022 philosophers Albert Schweitzer, Owen Barfield and Richard Tarnas;\n  \u2022 writers Saul Bellow, Andrej Belyj, Michael Ende, Selma Lagerl\u00f6f, Edouard Schur\u00e9, David Spangler, and William Irwin Thompson;\n  \u2022 child psychiatrist Eva Frommer;\n  \u2022 music therapist Maria Sch\u00fcppel\n  \u2022 economist Leonard Read;\n  \u2022 ecologist Rachel Carson;\n  \u2022 artists Joseph Beuys, Wassily Kandinsky, and Murray Griffin;\n  \u2022 esotericist and educationalist George Trevelyan;\n  \u2022 actor and acting teacher Michael Chekhov;\n  \u2022 cinema director Andrei Tarkovsky;\n  \u2022 composers Jonathan Harvey and Viktor Ullmann; and\n  \u2022 conductor Bruno Walter.\nOlav Hammer, though sharply critical of esoteric movements generally, terms Steiner \"arguably the most historically and philosophically sophisticated spokesperson of the Esoteric Tradition.\"\nAlbert Schweitzer wrote that he and Steiner had in common that they had \"taken on the life mission of working for the emergence of a true culture enlivened by the ideal of humanity and to encourage people to become truly thinking beings\". However, Schweitzer was not an adept of mysticism or occultism, but of Age of Enlightenment rationalism.\nAnthony Storr stated about Rudolf Steiner's Anthroposophy: \"His belief system is so eccentric, so unsupported by evidence, so manifestly bizarre, that rational skeptics are bound to consider it delusional.... But, whereas Einstein's way of perceiving the world by thought became confirmed by experiment and mathematical proof, Steiner's remained intensely subjective and insusceptible of objective confirmation.\"\nRobert Todd Carroll has said of Steiner that \"Some of his ideas on education \u2013 such as educating the handicapped in the mainstream \u2013 are worth considering, although his overall plan for developing the spirit and the soul rather than the intellect cannot be admired\". Translators have pointed out that the German term Geist can be translated equally properly as either mind or spirit, however, and that Steiner's usage of this term encompassed both meanings.\nThe 150th anniversary of Rudolf Steiner's birth was marked by the first major retrospective exhibition of his art and work, 'Kosmos - Alchemy of the everyday'. Organized by Vitra Design Museum, the traveling exhibition presented many facets of Steiner's life and achievements, including his influence on architecture, furniture design, dance (Eurythmy), education, and agriculture (Biodynamic agriculture). The exhibition opened in 2011 at the Kunstmuseum in Stuttgart, Germany,\nThe German psychiatrist Wolfgang Treher diagnosed Rudolf Steiner with schizophrenia, in a book from 1966. The Swiss psychiatrist C.G. Jung was of the same opinion.\n### Scientism\nOlav Hammer has criticized as scientism Steiner's claim to use scientific methodology to investigate spiritual phenomena that were based upon his claims of clairvoyant experience. Steiner regarded the observations of spiritual research as more dependable (and above all, consistent) than observations of physical reality. However, he did consider spiritual research to be fallible, and held the view that anyone capable of thinking logically was in a position to correct errors by spiritual researchers.\n### Race and ethnicity\nRudolf Steiner was an extreme pan-German nationalist, and never disavowed such stance.\nSteiner's work includes both universalist, humanist elements and racial assumptions. Due to the contrast and even contradictions between these elements, one commentator argues: \"whether a given reader interprets Anthroposophy as racist or not depends upon that reader's concerns\". Steiner considered that by dint of its shared language and culture, each people has a unique essence, which he called its soul or spirit. He saw race as a physical manifestation of humanity's spiritual evolution, and at times discussed race in terms of complex hierarchies that were largely derived from 19th century biology, anthropology, philosophy and theosophy. However, he consistently and explicitly subordinated race, ethnicity, gender, and indeed all hereditary factors, to individual factors in development. For Steiner, human individuality is centered in a person's unique biography, and he believed that an individual's experiences and development are not bound by a single lifetime or the qualities of the physical body.\nSteiner occasionally characterized specific races, nations and ethnicities in ways that have been deemed racist by critics. This includes descriptions by him of certain races and ethnic groups as flowering, others as backward, or destined to degenerate or disappear. He presented explicitly hierarchical views of the spiritual evolution of different races, including\u2014at times, and inconsistently\u2014portraying the white race, European culture or Germanic culture as representing the high point of human evolution as of the early 20th century, although he did describe them as destined to be superseded by future cultures.\nThroughout his life Steiner consistently emphasized the core spiritual unity of all the world's peoples and sharply criticized racial prejudice. He articulated beliefs that the individual nature of any person stands higher than any racial, ethnic, national or religious affiliation. His belief that race and ethnicity are transient and superficial, and not essential aspects of the individual, was partly rooted in his conviction that each individual reincarnates in a variety of different peoples and races over successive lives, and that each of us thus bears within him or herself the heritage of many races and peoples. Toward the end of his life, Steiner predicted that race will rapidly lose any remaining significance for future generations. In Steiner's view, culture is universal, and explicitly not ethnically based, and he vehemently criticized imperialism.\nIn the context of his ethical individualism, Steiner considered \"race, folk, ethnicity and gender\" to be general, describable categories into which individuals may choose to fit, but from which free human beings can and will liberate themselves.\nMartins and Vukadinovi\u0107 describe the racism of Anthroposophy as spiritual and paternalistic (i.e. benevolent), in contrast to the materialistic and often malign racism of fascism. Olav Hammer, university professor expert in new religious movements and Western esotericism, confirms that now the racist and anti-Semitic character of Steiner's teachings can no longer be denied, even if that is \"spiritual racism\".\nSteiner did influence Italian Fascism, which exploited \"his racial and anti-democratic dogma.\" The fascist ministers Giovanni Antonio Colonna di Cesar\u00f2 (nicknamed \"the Anthroposophist duke\"; he became antifascist after taking part in Benito Mussolini's government) and Ettore Martinoli have openly expressed their sympathy for Rudolf Steiner. Most from the occult pro-fascist UR Group were Anthroposophists.\nIn fact, \"Steiner's collected works, moreover, totalling more than 350 volumes, contain pervasive internal contradictions and inconsistencies on racial and national questions.\"\nAccording to Munoz, in the materialist perspective (i.e. no reincarnations), Anthroposophy is racist, but in the spiritual perspective (i.e. reincarnations mandatory) it is not racist.\n#### Judaism\nDuring the years when Steiner was best known as a literary critic, he published a series of articles attacking various manifestations of antisemitism and criticizing some of the most prominent anti-Semites of the time as \"barbaric\" and \"enemies of culture\". In contrast, however, Steiner also promoted full assimilation of the Jewish people into the nations in which they lived, suggesting that Jewish cultural and social life had lost its contemporary relevance and \"that Judaism still exists is an error of history\". Steiner was a critic of his contemporary Theodor Herzl's goal of a Zionist state, and indeed of any ethnically determined state, as he considered ethnicity to be an outmoded basis for social life and civic identity.\nSteiner financed the publication of and wrote a foreword for the book Die Entente-Freimaurerei und der Weltkrieg (1919) by Karl Heise, partly based upon his own ideas, a book which has been called \"a now classic work of anti-Masonry and anti-Judaism.\" The publication comprised a conspiracy theory according to which World War I was a consequence of a collusion of Freemasons and Jews their purpose being the destruction of Germany. The writing was later enthusiastically received by the Nazi Party. \n", "## Writings (selection)\n\nSee also Works in German\nThe standard edition of Steiner's Collected Works constitutes about 422 volumes.

{"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karl_Pearson", "text_list": ["# Karl Pearson\n\nKarl Pearson FRS FRSE (/\u02c8p\u026a\u0259rs\u0259n/; born Carl Pearson; 27 March 1857 \u2013 27 April 1936) was an English biostatistician, eugenicist, and mathematician. He has been credited with establishing the discipline of mathematical statistics. He founded the world's first university statistics department at University College London in 1911, and contributed significantly to the field of biometrics and meteorology. Pearson was also a proponent of Social Darwinism and eugenics, and his thought is an example of what is today described as scientific racism. Pearson was a prot\u00e9g\u00e9 and biographer of Sir Francis Galton. He edited and completed both William Kingdon Clifford's Common Sense of the Exact Sciences (1885) and Isaac Todhunter's History of the Theory of Elasticity, Vol. 1 (1886\u20131893) and Vol. 2 (1893), following their deaths.\n", "## Early life and education\n\nPearson was born in Islington, London, into a Quaker family. His father was William Pearson QC of the Inner Temple, and his mother Fanny (n\u00e9e Smith), and he had two siblings, Arthur and Amy. Pearson attended University College School, followed by King's College, Cambridge, in 1876 to study mathematics, graduating in 1879 as Third Wrangler in the Mathematical Tripos. He then travelled to Germany to study physics at the University of Heidelberg under G. H. Quincke and metaphysics under Kuno Fischer. He next visited the University of Berlin, where he attended the lectures of the physiologist Emil du Bois-Reymond on Darwinism (Emil was a brother of Paul du Bois-Reymond, the mathematician). Pearson also studied Roman Law, taught by Bruns and Mommsen, medieval and 16th century German Literature, and Socialism. He became an accomplished historian and Germanist and spent much of the 1880s in Berlin, Heidelberg, Vienna, Saig bei Lenzkirch, and Brixlegg. He wrote on Passion plays, religion, Goethe, Werther, as well as sex-related themes, and was a founder of the Men and Women's Club.\nPearson was offered a Germanics post at King's College, Cambridge. Comparing Cambridge students to those he knew from Germany, Karl found German students inathletic and weak. He wrote to his mother, \"I used to think athletics and sport was overestimated at Cambridge, but now I think it cannot be too highly valued.\"\nOn returning to England in 1880, Pearson first went to Cambridge:\n    Back in Cambridge, I worked in the engineering shops, but drew up the schedule in Mittel- and Althochdeutsch for the Medieval Languages Tripos.\nIn his first book, The New Werther, Pearson gives a clear indication of why he studied so many diverse subjects:\n    I rush from science to philosophy, and from philosophy to our old friends the poets; and then, over-wearied by too much idealism, I fancy I become practical in returning to science. Have you ever attempted to conceive all there is in the world worth knowing\u2014that not one subject in the universe is unworthy of study? The giants of literature, the mysteries of many-dimensional space, the attempts of Boltzmann and Crookes to penetrate Nature's very laboratory, the Kantian theory of the universe, and the latest discoveries in embryology, with their wonderful tales of the development of life\u2014what an immensity beyond our grasp! [...] Mankind seems on the verge of a new and glorious discovery. What Newton did to simplify the planetary motions must now be done to unite in one whole the various isolated theories of mathematical physics.\nPearson then returned to London to study law, emulating his father. Quoting Pearson's own account:\n    Coming to London, I read in chambers in Lincoln's Inn, drew up bills of sale, and was called to the Bar, but varied legal studies by lecturing on heat at Barnes, on Martin Luther at Hampstead, and on Lassalle and Marx on Sundays at revolutionary clubs around Soho.\n", "## Career\n\nHis next career move was to the Inner Temple, where he read law until 1881 (although he never practised). After this, he returned to mathematics, deputising for the mathematics professor at King's College, London in 1881 and for the professor at University College London in 1883. In 1884, he was appointed to the Goldsmid Chair of Applied Mathematics and Mechanics at University College London. Pearson became the editor of Common Sense of the Exact Sciences (1885) when William Kingdon Clifford died. 1891 saw him also appointed to the professorship of Geometry at Gresham College; here he met Walter Frank Raphael Weldon, a zoologist who had some interesting problems requiring quantitative solutions. The collaboration, in biometry and evolutionary theory, was a fruitful one and lasted until Weldon died in 1906. Weldon introduced Pearson to Charles Darwin's cousin Francis Galton, who was interested in aspects of evolution such as heredity and eugenics. Pearson became Galton's prot\u00e9g\u00e9, at times to the verge of hero worship.\nAfter Galton's death in 1911, Pearson embarked on producing his definitive biography\u2014a three-volume tome of narrative, letters, genealogies, commentaries, and photographs\u2014published in 1914, 1924, and 1930, with much of Pearson's own money paying for their print runs. The biography, done \"to satisfy myself and without regard to traditional standards, to the needs of publishers or to the tastes of the reading public\", triumphed Galton's life, work and personal heredity. He predicted that Galton, rather than Charles Darwin, would be remembered as the most prodigious grandson of Erasmus Darwin.\nWhen Galton died, he left the residue of his estate to the University of London for a chair in Eugenics. Pearson was the first holder of this chair\u2014the Galton Chair of Eugenics, later the Galton Chair of Genetics\u2014in accordance with Galton's wishes. Pearson formed the Department of Applied Statistics (with financial support from the Drapers' Company), which combined the Biometric and Galton Laboratories. He remained with the department until his retirement in 1933, and continued to work until his death.\n", "## Personal life\n\nIn 1890, Pearson married Maria Sharpe. The couple had three children: Sigrid Loetitia Pearson, Helga Sharpe Pearson, and Egon Pearson, who became a statistician himself and succeeded his father as head of the Applied Statistics Department at University College. Maria died in 1928 and in 1929 Karl married Margaret Victoria Child, a co-worker at the Biometric Laboratory. He and his family lived at 7 Well Road in Hampstead, now marked with a blue plaque. He died at Coldharbour, Surrey, on 27 April 1936.\n", "## Einstein and Pearson's work\n\nWhen the 23-year-old Albert Einstein started the Olympia Academy study group in 1902, with his two younger friends, Maurice Solovine and Conrad Habicht, his first reading suggestion was Pearson's The Grammar of Science. This book covered several themes that were later to become part of the theories of Einstein and other scientists. Pearson asserted that the laws of nature are relative to the perceptive ability of the observer. Irreversibility of natural processes, he argued, is a purely relative conception. An observer who travels at the exact velocity of light would see an eternal now, or an absence of motion. He speculated that an observer who travelled faster than light would see time reversal, similar to a cinema film being run backwards. Pearson also discussed antimatter, the fourth dimension, and wrinkles in time.\nPearson's relativity was based on idealism, in the sense of ideas or pictures in a mind. \"There are many signs\", he wrote, \"that a sound idealism is surely replacing, as a basis for natural philosophy, the crude materialism of the older physicists.\" (Preface to second Ed., The Grammar of Science) Further, he stated, \"... science is in reality a classification and analysis of the contents of the mind ... In truth, the field of science is much more consciousness than an external world.\" (Ibid., Ch. II, \u00a7 6) \"Law in the scientific sense is thus essentially a product of the human mind and has no meaning apart from man.\" (Ibid., Ch. III, \u00a7 4)\n", "## Political views and eugenics\n\nPearson was a \"zealous\" atheist, \"freethinker\", and socialist. He gave lectures on such issues as \"the woman's question\" (this was the era of the suffragist movement in the UK) and upon Karl Marx. His commitment to socialism and its ideals led him to refuse the offer of being created an OBE (Officer of the Order of the British Empire) in 1920 and also to refuse a knighthood in 1935.\nA eugenicist who applied social Darwinism to entire nations, Pearson saw war against \"inferior races\" as a logical implication of the theory of evolution. \"My view \u2013 and I think it may be called the scientific view of a nation\", he wrote, \"is that of an organized whole, kept up to a high pitch of internal efficiency by insuring that its numbers are substantially recruited from the better stocks, and kept up to a high pitch of external efficiency by contest, chiefly by way of war with inferior races.\" He reasoned that, if August Weismann's theory of germ plasm is correct, the nation is wasting money when it tries to improve people who come from poor stock.\nWeismann argued that acquired characteristics could not be inherited. Therefore, training benefits only the trained generation. Their children will not exhibit the learned improvements and, in turn, will need to be improved. \"No degenerate and feeble stock will ever be converted into healthy and sound stock by the accumulated effects of education, good laws, and sanitary surroundings. Such means may render the individual members of a stock passable if not strong members of society, but the same process will have to be gone through again and again with their offspring, and this in ever-widening circles, if the stock, owing to the conditions in which society has placed it, is able to increase its numbers.\"\n    History shows me one way, and one way only, in which a high state of civilization has been produced, namely, the struggle of race with race, and the survival of the physically and mentally fitter race. If you want to know whether the lower races of man can evolve a higher type, I fear the only course is to leave them to fight it out among themselves, and even then the struggle for existence between individual and individual, between tribe and tribe, may not be supported by that physical selection due to a particular climate on which probably so much of the Aryan's success depended.\nIn The Myth of the Jewish Race Raphael and Jennifer Patai cite Karl Pearson's 1925 opposition (in the first issue of the journal Annals of Eugenics which he founded) to Jewish immigration into Britain. Pearson alleged that these immigrants \"will develop into a parasitic race. [...] Taken on the average, and regarding both sexes, this alien Jewish population is somewhat inferior physically and mentally to the native population\".\nPearson concluding remarks on stepping down as editor of the Annals of Eugenics, indicate a sense of failure of his aim to use the scientific study of eugenics as a guide for moral conduct and public policy. \n    My  endeavour during the twenty-two years in which I have held the post of  Galton Professor has been to prove in the first place that Eugenics can be developed as an academic study, and in the second place to make the conclusions drawn from  that study a ground for social propagandism only when there are sound scientific reasons upon which to base our judgments and as a result  our opinions as to moral conduct.  Even  at the present  day there are far too many general impressions drawn from limited or too often wrongly interpreted experience, and far too many inadequately demonstrated and too lightly accepted theories for any nation to proceed hastily with unlimited Eugenic legislation. This statement, however, must never be taken as an excuse for indefinitely suspending all Eugenic teaching and every form of communal action in matters of sex.\nNonetheless, in June 2020 UCL announced that it was renaming two buildings which had been named after Pearson, because of his connection with eugenics.\n", "## Contributions to biometrics\n\nKarl Pearson was important in the founding of the school of biometrics, which was one of several competing theories to describe evolution and population inheritance at the turn of the 20th century. His series of eighteen papers, \"Mathematical Contributions to the Theory of Evolution\" established him as the founder of the biometrical school for inheritance. In fact, Pearson devoted much time during 1893 to 1904 to developing statistical techniques for biometry. These techniques, which are widely used today for statistical analysis, include the chi-squared test, standard deviation, and correlation and regression coefficients. Pearson's Law of Ancestral Heredity stated that germ plasm consisted of heritable elements inherited from the parents as well as from more distant ancestors, the proportion of which varied for different traits. Karl Pearson was a follower of Galton, and although the two differed in some respects, Pearson used a substantial amount of Francis Galton's statistical concepts in his formulation of the biometrical school for inheritance, such as the law of regression. The biometric school, unlike the Mendelians, focused not on providing a mechanism for inheritance, but rather on providing a mathematical description for inheritance that was not causal in nature. While Galton proposed a discontinuous theory of evolution, in which species would have to change via large jumps rather than small changes that built up over time, Pearson pointed out flaws in Galton's argument and actually used Galton's ideas to further a continuous theory of evolution, whereas the Mendelians favored a discontinuous theory of evolution. While Galton focused primarily on the application of statistical methods to the study of heredity, Pearson and his colleague Weldon expanded statistical reasoning to the fields of inheritance, variation, correlation, and natural and sexual selection.\nFor Pearson, the theory of evolution was not intended to identify a biological mechanism that explained patterns of inheritance, whereas Mendelian's theory postulated the gene as the mechanism for inheritance. Pearson criticized Bateson and other biologists for their failure to adopt biometrical techniques in their study of evolution. Pearson criticized biologists who did not focus on the statistical validity of their theories, stating that \"before we can accept [any cause of a progressive change] as a factor we must have not only shown its plausibility but if possible have demonstrated its quantitative ability\" Biologists had succumb to \"almost metaphysical speculation as to the causes of heredity,\" which had replaced the process of experimental data collection that actually might allow scientists to narrow down potential theories.\nFor Pearson, laws of nature were useful for making accurate predictions and for concisely describing trends in observed data. Causation was the experience \"that a certain sequence has occurred and recurred in the past\". Thus, identifying a particular mechanism of genetics was not a worthy pursuit of biologists, who should instead focus on mathematical descriptions of empirical data. This, in part led to the fierce debate between the biometricians and the Mendelians, including Bateson. After Bateson rejected one of Pearson's manuscripts that described a new theory for the variability of an offspring, or homotyposis, Pearson and Weldon established Biometrika in 1902. Although the biometric approach to inheritance eventually lost to the Mendelian approach, the techniques Pearson and the biometricians at the time developed are vital to studies of biology and evolution today.\n", "## Contributions to statistics\n\nPearson's work was all-embracing in the wide application and development of mathematical statistics, and encompassed the fields of biology, epidemiology, anthropometry, medicine, psychology and social history. In 1901, with Weldon and Galton, he founded the journal Biometrika whose object was the development of statistical theory. He edited this journal until his death. Among those who assisted Pearson in his research were a number of female mathematicians who included Beatrice Mabel Cave-Browne-Cave, Frances Cave-Browne-Cave, and Alice Lee. He also founded the journal Annals of Eugenics (now Annals of Human Genetics) in 1925. He published the Drapers' Company Research Memoirs largely to provide a record of the output of the Department of Applied Statistics not published elsewhere.\nPearson's thinking underpins many of the 'classical' statistical methods which are in common use today. Examples of his contributions are:\n  \u2022 Correlation coefficient. The correlation coefficient (first developed by Auguste Bravais and Francis Galton) was defined as a product-moment, and its relationship with linear regression was studied.\n  \u2022 Method of moments. Pearson introduced moments, a concept borrowed from physics, as descriptive statistics and for the fitting of distributions to samples.\n  \u2022 Pearson's system of continuous curves. A system of continuous univariate probability distributions that came to form the basis of the now conventional continuous probability distributions. Since the system is complete up to the fourth moment, it is a powerful complement to the Pearsonian method of moments.\n  \u2022 Chi distance. A precursor and special case of the Mahalanobis distance.\n  \u2022 p-value. Defined as the probability measure of the complement of the ball with the hypothesized value as center point and chi distance as radius.\n  \u2022 Foundations of statistical hypothesis testing theory and statistical decision theory. In the seminal \"On the criterion...\" paper, Pearson proposed testing the validity of hypothesized values by evaluating the chi distance between the hypothesized and the empirically observed values via the p-value, which was proposed in the same paper. The use of preset evidence criteria, so called alpha type-I error probabilities, was later proposed by Jerzy Neyman and Egon Pearson.\n  \u2022 Pearson's chi-squared test. A hypothesis test using normal approximation for discrete data.\n  \u2022 Principal component analysis. The method of fitting a linear subspace to multivariate data by minimising the chi distances.\n  \u2022 The first introduction of the histogram is usually credited to Pearson.\n", "## Awards from professional bodies\n\nPearson achieved widespread recognition across a range of disciplines and his membership of, and awards from, various professional bodies reflects this:\n  \u2022 1896: elected FRS: Fellow of the Royal Society\n  \u2022 1898: awarded the Darwin Medal\n  \u2022 1911: awarded the honorary degree of LLD from the University of St Andrews\n  \u2022 1911: awarded a DSc from University of London\n  \u2022 1920: offered (and refused) the OBE\n  \u2022 1932: awarded the Rudolf Virchow medal by the Berliner Anthropologische Gesellschaft\n  \u2022 1934: offered (and refused) the Guy Medal of the Royal Statistical Society\n  \u2022 1935: offered (and refused) a knighthood\nHe was also elected an Honorary Fellow of King's College, Cambridge, the Royal Society of Edinburgh, University College London and the Royal Society of Medicine, and a Member of the Actuaries' Club. A sesquicentenary conference was held in London on 23 March 2007, to celebrate the 150th anniversary of his birth.\n", "## Publications\n\n\n  \u2022 Pearson, Karl (1880). The New Werther.

Windelband was a neo-Kantian who argued against other contemporary neo-Kantians, maintaining that \"to understand Kant rightly means to go beyond him\". Against his positivist contemporaries, Windelband argued that philosophy should engage in humanistic dialogue with the natural sciences rather than uncritically appropriating its methodologies. His interests in psychology and cultural sciences represented an opposition to psychologism and historicism schools by a critical philosophic system.\nWindelband relied in his effort to reach beyond Kant on such philosophers as Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel, Johann Friedrich Herbart and Hermann Lotze. Closely associated with Windelband was Heinrich Rickert.

He argued that positivism is a false account of knowing.\nHis wide-ranging research in physical science included chemical kinetics, x-ray diffraction, and adsorption of gases. He pioneered the theory of fibre diffraction analysis in 1921, and the dislocation theory of plastic deformation of ductile metals and other materials in 1934. He emigrated to Germany, in 1926 becoming a chemistry professor at the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute in Berlin, and then in 1933 to England, becoming first a chemistry professor, and then a social sciences professor at the University of Manchester. Two of his pupils won the Nobel Prize, as well as one of his children. In 1944 Polanyi was elected to the Royal Society.\nThe contributions which Polanyi made to the social sciences include the concept of a polycentric spontaneous order and his rejection of a value neutral conception of liberty. They were developed in the context of his opposition to central planning.\n", "## Life\n\n### Early life\nPolanyi, born Mih\u00e1ly Pollacsek in Budapest, was the fifth child of Mih\u00e1ly and Cec\u00edlia Pollacsek (born as Cec\u00edlia Wohl), secular Jews from Ungv\u00e1r (then in Hungary but now in Ukraine) and Wilno, then Russian Empire, respectively. His father's family were entrepreneurs, while his mother's father, Osher Leyzerovich Vol, was the senior teacher of Jewish history at the Vilna rabbinic seminary. The family moved to Budapest and Magyarized their surname to Pol\u00e1nyi. His father built much of the Hungarian railway system, but lost most of his fortune in 1899 when bad weather caused a railway building project to go over budget. He died in 1905. Cec\u00edlia Pol\u00e1nyi established a salon that was well known among Budapest's intellectuals, and which continued until her death in 1939. His older brother was Karl Polanyi, the political economist and anthropologist, and his niece was Eva Zeisel, a world-renowned ceramist.\n### Education\nIn 1908 Polanyi graduated the teacher-training secondary school, the Minta Gymnasium. He then studied medicine at the University of Budapest, obtaining his medical diploma in 1914. He was an active member of the Galileo Circle. With the support of Ign\u00e1c Pfeifer, professor of chemistry at the Royal Joseph University of Budapest, he obtained a scholarship to study chemistry at the Technische Hochschule in Karlsruhe, Germany. In the First World War, he served in the Austro-Hungarian army as a medical officer, and was sent to the Serbian front. While on sick-leave in 1916, he wrote a PhD thesis on adsorption. His research, which was encouraged by Albert Einstein, and supervised by Guszt\u00e1v Buchb\u00f6ck, and in 1919 the Royal University of Pest awarded him a doctorate.\n### Career\nIn October 1918, Mih\u00e1ly K\u00e1rolyi established the Hungarian Democratic Republic, and Polanyi became Secretary to the Minister of Health. When the Communists seized power in March 1919, he returned to medicine. When the Hungarian Soviet Republic was overthrown, Polanyi emigrated to Karlsruhe in Germany, and was invited by Fritz Haber to join the Kaiser Wilhelm Institut f\u00fcr Faserstoffchemie (fiber chemistry) in Berlin. A Christian since 1913, in a Roman Catholic ceremony he married Magda Elizabeth Kemeny. In 1926 he became the professorial head of department of the Institut f\u00fcr Physikalische Chemie und Elektrochemie (now the Fritz Haber Institute). In 1929, Magda gave birth to their son John, who was awarded a Nobel Prize in chemistry in 1986. Their other son, George Polanyi, who predeceased him, became a well-known economist.\nHis experience of runaway inflation and high unemployment in Weimar Germany led Polanyi to become interested in economics. With the coming to power in 1933 of the Nazi party, he accepted a chair in physical chemistry at the University of Manchester. Two of his pupils, Eugene Wigner and Melvin Calvin, went on to win the Nobel Prize. Because of his increasing interest in the social sciences, Manchester University created a new chair in Social Science (1948\u201358) for him.\nPolanyi was among the 2,300 names of prominent persons listed on the Nazis' Special Search List, of those who were to be arrested on the invasion of Great Britain and turned over to the Gestapo.\nFrom June 1944 to 1947, Polanyi participated in the activities of The Moot, a Christian discussion circle concerned with shaping the post-war society, at the invitation of Karl Mannheim and J. H. Oldham.\nIn 1944 Polanyi was elected a member of the Royal Society, and on his retirement from the University of Manchester in 1958 he was elected a senior research fellow at Merton College, Oxford. In 1962 he was elected a foreign honorary member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences.\n", "## Work\n\n### Physical chemistry\nPolanyi's scientific interests were extremely diverse, including work in chemical kinetics, x-ray diffraction, and the adsorption of gases at solid surfaces. He is also well known for his potential adsorption theory, which was disputed for quite some time. In 1921, he laid the mathematical foundation of fibre diffraction analysis. In 1934, Polanyi, at about the same time as G. I. Taylor and Egon Orowan, realised that the plastic deformation of ductile materials could be explained in terms of the theory of dislocations developed by Vito Volterra in 1905. The insight was critical in developing the field of solid mechanics.\n### Freedom and community\nIn 1936, as a consequence of an invitation to give lectures for the Ministry of Heavy Industry in the USSR, Polanyi met Bukharin, who told him that in socialist societies all scientific research is directed to accord with the needs of the latest Five Year Plan. Polanyi noted what had happened to the study of genetics in the Soviet Union once the doctrines of Trofim Lysenko had gained the backing of the State. Demands in Britain, for example by the Marxist John Desmond Bernal, for centrally planned scientific research led Polanyi to defend the claim that science requires free debate. Together with John Baker, he founded the influential Society for Freedom in Science.\nIn a series of articles, re-published in The Contempt of Freedom (1940) and The Logic of Liberty (1951), Polanyi claimed that co-operation amongst scientists is analogous to the way agents co-ordinate themselves within a free market. Just as consumers in a free market determine the value of products, science is a spontaneous order that arises as a consequence of open debate amongst specialists. Science (contrary to the claims of Bukharin) flourishes when scientists have the liberty to pursue truth as an end in itself:\n    [S]cientists, freely making their own choice of problems and pursuing them in the light of their own personal judgment, are in fact co-operating as members of a closely knit organization.\n    Such self-co-ordination of independent initiatives leads to a joint result which is unpremeditated by any of those who bring it about.\n    Any attempt to organize the group ... under a single authority would eliminate their independent initiatives, and thus reduce their joint effectiveness to that of the single person directing them from the centre. It would, in effect, paralyse their co-operation.\n\nHe derived the phrase spontaneous order from Gestalt psychology, and it was adopted by the classical liberal economist Friederich Hayek, although the concept can be traced back to at least Adam Smith. Polanyi unlike Hayek argued that there are higher and lower forms of spontaneous order, and he asserted that defending scientific inquiry on utilitarian or sceptical grounds undermined the practice of science. He extends this into a general claim about free societies. Polanyi defends a free society not on the negative grounds that we ought to respect \"private liberties\", but on the positive grounds that \"public liberties\" facilitate our pursuit of spiritual ends.\nAccording to Polanyi, a free society that strives to be value-neutral undermines its own justification. But it is not enough for the members of a free society to believe that ideals such as truth, justice, and beauty, are not simply subjective, they also have to accept that they transcend our ability to wholly capture them. The non-subjectivity of values must be combined with acceptance that all knowing is fallible.\nIn Full Employment and Free Trade (1948) Polanyi analyses the way money circulates around an economy, and in a monetarist analysis that, according to Paul Craig Roberts, was thirty years ahead of its time, he argues that a free market economy should not be left to be wholly self-adjusting. A central bank should attempt to moderate economic booms/busts via a strict/loose monetary policy.\nIn 1940, he produced a film,  \"Unemployment and money. The principles involved\", perhaps the first film about economics. The film defended a version of Keynesianism, neutral Keynesianism, that advised the State to use budget deficit and tax reductions to increase the amount of money in the circulation in times of economic hardship but did not seek direct investment or engage in public works.\n### All knowing is personal\nIn his book Science, Faith and Society (1946), Polanyi set out his opposition to a positivist account of science, noting that among other things it ignores the role personal commitments play in the practice of science. Polanyi gave the Gifford Lectures in 1951\u201352 at Aberdeen, and a revised version of his lectures were later published as Personal Knowledge (1958). In this book Polanyi claims that all knowledge claims (including those that derive from rules) rely on personal judgments. He denies that a scientific method can yield truth mechanically. All knowing, no matter how formalised, relies upon commitments. Polanyi argued that the assumptions that underlie critical philosophy are not only false, they undermine the commitments that motivate our highest achievements. He advocates a fiduciary post-critical approach, in which we recognise that we believe more than we can know, and know more than we can say.\nA knower does not stand apart from the universe, but participates personally within it. Our intellectual skills are driven by passionate commitments that motivate discovery and validation. According to Polanyi, a great scientist not only identifies patterns, but also significant questions likely to lead to a successful resolution. Innovators risk their reputation by committing to a hypothesis. Polanyi cites the example of Copernicus, who declared that the Earth revolves around the Sun. He claims that Copernicus arrived at the Earth's true relation to the Sun not as a consequence of following a method, but via \"the greater intellectual satisfaction he derived from the celestial panorama as seen from the Sun instead of the Earth.\" His writings on the practice of science influenced Thomas Kuhn and Paul Feyerabend.\nPolanyi rejected the claim by British Empiricists that experience can be reduced into sense data, but he also rejects the notion that \"indwelling\" within (sometimes incompatible) interpretative frameworks traps us within them. Our tacit awareness connects us, albeit fallibly, with reality. It supplies us with the context within which our articulations have meaning. Contrary to the views of his colleague and friend Alan Turing, whose work at the Victoria University of Manchester prepared the way for the first modern computer, he denied that minds are reducible to collections of rules. His work influenced the critique by Hubert Dreyfus of \"First Generation\" artificial intelligence.\nIt was while writing Personal Knowledge that he identified the \"structure of tacit knowing\". He viewed it as his most important discovery. He claimed that we experience the world by integrating our subsidiary awareness into a focal awareness. In his later work, for example his Terry Lectures, later published as The Tacit Dimension (1966), he distinguishes between the phenomenological, instrumental, semantic, and ontological aspects of tacit knowing, as discussed (but not necessarily identified as such) in his previous writing.\n### Critique of reductionism\nIn \"Life's irreducible structure\" (1968), Polanyi argues that the information contained in the DNA molecule is not reducible to the laws of physics and chemistry. Although a DNA molecule cannot exist without physical properties, these properties are constrained by higher-level ordering principles. In \"Transcendence and Self-transcendence\" (1970), Polanyi criticises the mechanistic world view that modern science inherited from Galileo.\nPolanyi advocates emergence i.e. the claim that there are several levels of reality and of causality. He relies on the assumption that boundary conditions supply degrees of freedom that, instead of being random, are determined by higher-level realities, whose properties are dependent on but distinct from the lower level from which they emerge. An example of a higher-level reality functioning as a downward causal force is consciousness \u2013 intentionality \u2013 generating meanings \u2013 intensionality.\nMind is a higher-level expression of the capacity of living organisms for discrimination. Our pursuit of self-set ideals such as truth and justice transform our understanding of the world. The reductionistic attempt to reduce higher-level realities into lower-level realities generates what Polanyi calls a moral inversion, in which the higher is rejected with moral passion. Polanyi identifies it as a pathology of the modern mind and traces its origins to a false conception of knowledge; although it is relatively harmless in the formal sciences, that pathology generates nihilism in the humanities. Polanyi considered Marxism an example of moral inversion. The State, on the grounds of an appeal to the logic of history, uses its coercive powers in ways that disregard any appeals to morality.\n### Tacit knowledge\nTacit knowledge, as distinct from explicit knowledge, is an influential term developed by Polanyi in The Tacit Dimension to describe among other things the ability to do something without necessarily being able to articulate it: for example, being able to ride a bicycle or play a musical instrument without being able to fully explain the details of how it happens. He claims that not only do practical skills rely upon tacit awareness, all perception and meaning is rendered possible by agents relying upon their tacit awareness. Every consciousness has a subsidiary and a focal awareness, and this distinction also has an ontological dimension, because a lower and a higher dimension is how emergence takes place.\n", "## Bibliography\n\n\n  \u2022 1932.

He received a degree in mathematics, physics, and philosophy from the University of Debrecen in 1944. In March 1944 the Germans invaded Hungary, and Lakatos along with \u00c9va R\u00e9v\u00e9sz, his then-girlfriend and subsequent wife, formed soon after that event a Marxist resistance group. In May of that year, the group was joined by \u00c9va Izs\u00e1k, a 19-year-old Jewish antifascist activist. Lakatos, considering that there was a risk that she would be captured and forced to betray them, decided that her duty to the group was to commit suicide. Subsequently, a member of the group took her to Debrecen and gave her cyanide.\nDuring the occupation, Lakatos avoided Nazi persecution of Jews by changing his surname to Moln\u00e1r.  His mother and grandmother were murdered in Auschwitz. He changed his surname once again to Lakatos (Locksmith) in honor of G\u00e9za Lakatos.\nAfter the war, from 1947, he worked as a senior official in the Hungarian ministry of education. He also continued his education with a PhD at Debrecen University awarded in 1948 and also attended Gy\u00f6rgy Luk\u00e1cs's weekly Wednesday afternoon private seminars. He also studied at the Moscow State University under the supervision of Sofya Yanovskaya in 1949. When he returned, however, he found himself on the losing side of internal arguments within the Hungarian communist party and was imprisoned on charges of revisionism from 1950 to 1953. More of Lakatos's activities in Hungary after World War II have recently become known. In fact, Lakatos was a hardline Stalinist and, despite his young age, had an important role between 1945 and 1950 (his own arrest and jailing) in building up the Communist rule, especially in cultural life and the academia, in Hungary.\nAfter his release, Lakatos returned to academic life, doing mathematical research and translating George P\u00f3lya's How to Solve It into Hungarian. Still nominally a communist, his political views had shifted markedly, and he was involved with at least one dissident student group in the lead-up to the 1956 Hungarian Revolution.\nAfter the Soviet Union invaded Hungary in November 1956, Lakatos fled to Vienna and later reached England. He lived there for the rest of his life however he never achieved a British citizenship. He received a PhD in philosophy in 1961 from the University of Cambridge; his doctoral thesis was entitled Essays in the Logic of Mathematical Discovery, and his doctoral advisor was R. B. Braithwaite. The book Proofs and Refutations: The Logic of Mathematical Discovery, published after his death, is based on this work.\nIn 1960, he was appointed to a position in the London School of Economics (LSE), where he wrote on the philosophy of mathematics and the philosophy of science. The LSE philosophy of science department at that time included Karl Popper, Joseph Agassi and J. O. Wisdom. It was Agassi who first introduced Lakatos to Popper under the rubric of his applying a fallibilist methodology of conjectures and refutations to mathematics in his Cambridge PhD thesis.\nWith co-editor Alan Musgrave, he edited the often cited Criticism and the Growth of Knowledge, the Proceedings of the International Colloquium in the Philosophy of Science, London, 1965. Published in 1970, the 1965 Colloquium included well-known speakers delivering papers in response to Thomas Kuhn's The Structure of Scientific Revolutions.\nIn January 1971, he became editor of the British Journal for the Philosophy of Science, which J.\u00a0O. Wisdom had built up before departing in 1965, and he continued as editor until his death in 1974, after which it was then edited jointly for many years by his LSE colleagues John W.\u00a0N. Watkins and John Worrall, Lakatos's ex-research assistant. \nLakatos and his colleague Spiro Latsis organized an international conference in Greece in 1975, and went ahead despite his death. It was devoted entirely to historical case studies in Lakatos's methodology of research programmes in physical sciences and economics. These case studies in such as Einstein's relativity programme, Fresnel's wave theory of light and neoclassical economics, were published by Cambridge University Press in two separate volumes in 1976, one devoted to physical sciences and Lakatos's general programme for rewriting the history of science, with a concluding critique by his great friend Paul Feyerabend, and the other devoted to economics.\nHe remained at LSE until his sudden death in 1974 of a heart attack at the age of 51. The Lakatos Award was set up by the school in his memory. His last lectures along with some correspondance were published in Against Method. His last lectures along with parts of his correspondence with Paul Feyerabend have been published in For and Against Method.\n", "## Philosophical work\n\n### Philosophy of mathematics\nLakatos's philosophy of mathematics was inspired by both Hegel's and Marx's dialectic, by Karl Popper's theory of knowledge, and by the work of mathematician George P\u00f3lya.\nThe 1976 book Proofs and Refutations is based on the first three chapters of his 1961 four-chapter doctoral thesis Essays in the Logic of Mathematical Discovery. But its first chapter is Lakatos's own revision of its chapter\u00a01 that was first published as Proofs and Refutations in four parts in 1963\u201364 in the British Journal for the Philosophy of Science. It is largely taken up by a fictional dialogue set in a mathematics class. The students are attempting to prove the formula for the Euler characteristic in algebraic topology, which is a theorem about the properties of polyhedra, namely that for all polyhedra the number of their vertices V minus the number of their edges E plus the number of their faces F is 2 (V \u2212 E + F = 2). The dialogue is meant to represent the actual series of attempted proofs that mathematicians historically offered for the conjecture, only to be repeatedly refuted by counterexamples. Often the students paraphrase famous mathematicians such as Cauchy, as noted in Lakatos's extensive footnotes.\nLakatos termed the polyhedral counterexamples to Euler's formula monsters and distinguished three ways of handling these objects: Firstly, monster-barring, by which means the theorem in question could not be applied to such objects. Secondly, monster-adjustment, whereby by making a re-appraisal of the monster it could be made to obey the proposed theorem. Thirdly, exception handling, a further distinct process. These distinct strategies have been taken up in qualitative physics, where the terminology of monsters has been applied to apparent counterexamples, and the techniques of monster-barring and monster-adjustment recognized as approaches to the refinement of the analysis of a physical issue.\nWhat Lakatos tried to establish was that no theorem of informal mathematics is final or perfect. This means that we should not think that a theorem is ultimately true, only that no counterexample has yet been found. Once a counterexample is found, we adjust the theorem, possibly extending the domain of its validity. This is a continuous way our knowledge accumulates, through the logic and process of proofs and refutations. (If axioms are given for a branch of mathematics, however, Lakatos claimed that proofs from those axioms were tautological, i.e. logically true.)\nLakatos proposed an account of mathematical knowledge based on the idea of heuristics. In Proofs and Refutations the concept of \"heuristic\" was not well developed, although Lakatos gave several basic rules for finding proofs and counterexamples to conjectures. He thought that mathematical \"thought experiments\" are a valid way to discover mathematical conjectures and proofs, and sometimes called his philosophy \"quasi-empiricism\".\nHowever, he also conceived of the mathematical community as carrying on a kind of dialectic to decide which mathematical proofs are valid and which are not. Therefore, he fundamentally disagreed with the \"formalist\" conception of proof that prevailed in Frege's and Russell's logicism, which defines proof simply in terms of formal validity.\nOn its first publication as an article in the British Journal for the Philosophy of Science in 1963\u201364, Proofs and Refutations became highly influential on new work in the philosophy of mathematics, although few agreed with Lakatos's strong disapproval of formal proof. Before his death he had been planning to return to the philosophy of mathematics and apply his theory of research programmes to it. Lakatos, Worrall and Zahar use Poincar\u00e9 (1893) to answer one of the major problems perceived by critics, namely that the pattern of mathematical research depicted in Proofs and Refutations does not faithfully represent most of the actual activity of contemporary mathematicians.\n#### Cauchy and uniform convergence\nIn a 1966 text Cauchy and the continuum, Lakatos re-examines the history of the calculus, with special regard to Augustin-Louis Cauchy and the concept of uniform convergence, in the light of non-standard analysis. Lakatos is concerned that historians of mathematics should not judge the evolution of mathematics in terms of currently fashionable theories. As an illustration, he examines Cauchy's proof that the sum of a series of continuous functions is itself continuous.  Lakatos is critical of those who would see Cauchy's proof, with its failure to make explicit a suitable convergence hypothesis, merely as an inadequate approach to Weierstrassian analysis. Lakatos sees in such an approach a failure to realize that Cauchy's concept of the continuum differed from currently dominant views.\n### Research programmes\nLakatos's second major contribution to the philosophy of science was his model of the \"research programme\", which he formulated in an attempt to resolve the perceived conflict between Popper's falsificationism and the revolutionary structure of science described by Kuhn. Popper's standard of falsificationism was widely taken to imply that a theory should be abandoned as soon as any evidence appears to challenge it, while Kuhn's descriptions of scientific activity were taken to imply that science is most fruitful during periods in which popular, or \"normal\", theories are supported despite known anomalies. Lakatos's model of the research programme aims to combine Popper's adherence to empirical validity with Kuhn's appreciation for conventional consistency.\nA Lakatosian research programme is based on a hard core of theoretical assumptions that cannot be abandoned or altered without abandoning the programme altogether. More modest and specific theories that are formulated in order to explain evidence that threatens the \"hard core\" are termed auxiliary hypotheses. Auxiliary hypotheses are considered expendable by the adherents of the research programme\u2014they may be altered or abandoned as empirical discoveries require in order to \"protect\" the \"hard core\". Whereas Popper was generally read as hostile toward such ad hoc theoretical amendments, Lakatos argued that they can be progressive, i.e. productive, when they enhance the programme's explanatory and/or predictive power, and that they are at least permissible until some better system of theories is devised and the research programme is replaced entirely. The difference between a progressive and a degenerative research programme lies, for Lakatos, in whether the recent changes to its auxiliary hypotheses have achieved this greater explanatory/predictive power or whether they have been made simply out of the necessity of offering some response in the face of new and troublesome evidence. A degenerative research programme indicates that a new and more progressive system of theories should be sought to replace the currently prevailing one, but until such a system of theories can be conceived of and agreed upon, abandonment of the current one would only further weaken our explanatory power and was therefore unacceptable for Lakatos. Lakatos's primary example of a research programme that had been successful in its time and then progressively replaced is that founded by Isaac Newton, with his three laws of motion forming the \"hard core\".\nThe Lakatosian research programme deliberately provides a framework within which research can be conducted on the basis of \"first principles\" (the \"hard core\"), which are shared by those involved in the research programme and accepted for the purpose of that research without further proof or debate. In this regard, it is similar to Kuhn's notion of a paradigm. Lakatos sought to replace Kuhn's paradigm, guided by an irrational \"psychology of discovery\", with a research programme no less coherent or consistent, yet guided by Popper's objectively valid logic of discovery.\nLakatos was following Pierre Duhem's idea that one can always protect a cherished theory (or part of one) from hostile evidence by redirecting the criticism toward other theories or parts thereof. (See Confirmation holism and Duhem\u2013Quine thesis). This aspect of falsification had been acknowledged by Popper.\nPopper's theory, falsificationism, proposed that scientists put forward theories and that nature \"shouts NO\" in the form of an inconsistent observation. According to Popper, it is irrational for scientists to maintain their theories in the face of nature's rejection, as Kuhn had described them doing. For Lakatos, however, \"It is not that we propose a theory and Nature may shout NO; rather, we propose a maze of theories, and nature may shout INCONSISTENT\". The continued adherence to a programme's \"hard core\", augmented with adaptable auxiliary hypotheses, reflects Lakatos's less strict standard of falsificationism.\nLakatos saw himself as merely extending Popper's ideas, which changed over time and were interpreted by many in conflicting ways. In his 1968 article \"Criticism and the Methodology of Scientific Research Programmes\", Lakatos contrasted Popper0, the \"naive falsificationist\" who demanded unconditional rejection of any theory in the face of any anomaly (an interpretation Lakatos saw as erroneous but that he nevertheless referred to often); Popper1, the more nuanced and conservatively interpreted philosopher; and Popper2, the \"sophisticated methodological falsificationist\" that Lakatos claims is the logical extension of the correctly interpreted ideas of Popper1 (and who is therefore essentially Lakatos himself). It is, therefore, very difficult to determine which ideas and arguments concerning the research programme should be credited to whom.\nWhile Lakatos dubbed his theory \"sophisticated methodological falsificationism\", it is not \"methodological\" in the strict sense of asserting universal methodological rules by which all scientific research must abide. Rather, it is methodological only in that theories are only abandoned according to a methodical progression from worse theories to better theories\u2014a stipulation overlooked by what Lakatos terms \"dogmatic falsificationism\". Methodological assertions in the strict sense, pertaining to which methods are valid and which are invalid, are, themselves, contained within the research programmes that choose to adhere to them, and should be judged according to whether the research programmes that adhere to them prove progressive or degenerative. Lakatos divided these \"methodological rules\" within a research programme into its \"negative heuristics\", i.e., what research methods and approaches to avoid, and its \"positive heuristics\", i.e., what research methods and approaches to prefer. While the \"negative heuristic\" protects the hard core, the \"positive heuristic\" directs the modification of the hard core and auxiliary hypotheses in a general direction.\nLakatos claimed that not all changes of the auxiliary hypotheses of a research programme (which he calls \"problem shifts\") are equally productive or acceptable. He took the view that these \"problem shifts\" should be evaluated not just by their ability to defend the \"hard core\" by explaining apparent anomalies, but also by their ability to produce new facts, in the form of predictions or additional explanations. Adjustments that accomplish nothing more than the maintenance of the \"hard core\" mark the research programme as degenerative.\nLakatos's model provides for the possibility of a research programme that is not only continued in the presence of troublesome anomalies but that remains progressive despite them. For Lakatos, it is essentially necessary to continue on with a theory that we basically know cannot be completely true, and it is even possible to make scientific progress in doing so, as long as we remain receptive to a better research programme that may eventually be conceived of. In this sense, it is, for Lakatos, an acknowledged misnomer to refer to \"falsification\" or \"refutation\", when it is not the truth or falsity of a theory that is solely determining whether we consider it \"falsified\", but also the availability of a less false theory. A theory cannot be rightfully \"falsified\", according to Lakatos, until it is superseded by a better (i.e. more progressive) research programme. This is what he says is happening in the historical periods Kuhn describes as revolutions and what makes them rational as opposed to mere leaps of faith or periods of deranged social psychology, as Kuhn argued.\n### Pseudoscience\nAccording to the demarcation criterion of pseudoscience proposed by Lakatos, a theory is pseudoscientific if it fails to make any novel predictions of previously unknown phenomena or its predictions were mostly falsified, in contrast with scientific theories, which predict novel fact(s). Progressive scientific theories are those that have their novel facts confirmed, and degenerate scientific theories, which can degenerate so much that they become pseudo-science, are those whose predictions of novel facts are refuted. As he put it:\n  \"A given fact is explained scientifically only if a new fact is predicted with it\u00a0... The idea of growth and the concept of empirical character are soldered into one.\" See pages 34\u201335 of The Methodology of Scientific Research Programmes, 1978.\nLakatos's own key examples of pseudoscience were Ptolemaic astronomy, Immanuel Velikovsky's planetary cosmogony, Freudian psychoanalysis, 20th-century Soviet Marxism, Lysenko's biology, Niels Bohr's quantum mechanics post-1924, astrology, psychiatry, and neoclassical economics.\n#### Darwin's theory\nIn his 1973 Scientific Method Lecture 1 at the London School of Economics, he also claimed that \"nobody to date has yet found a demarcation criterion according to which Darwin can be described as scientific\".\nAlmost 20 years after Lakatos's 1973 challenge to the scientificity of Darwin, in her 1991 The Ant and the Peacock, LSE lecturer and ex-colleague of Lakatos, Helena Cronin, attempted to establish that Darwinian theory was empirically scientific in respect of at least being supported by evidence of likeness in the diversity of life forms in the world, explained by descent with modification. She wrote that\n    \n    our usual idea of corroboration as requiring the successful prediction of novel facts\u00a0... Darwinian theory was not strong on temporally novel predictions.\u00a0... however familiar the evidence and whatever role it played in the construction of the theory, it still confirms the theory.\n    \n\n### Rational reconstructions of the history of science\nIn his 1970 article \"History of Science and Its Rational Reconstructions\" Lakatos proposed a dialectical historiographical meta-method for evaluating different theories of scientific method, namely by means of their comparative success in explaining the actual history of science and scientific revolutions on the one hand, whilst on the other providing a historiographical framework for rationally reconstructing the history of science as anything more than merely inconsequential rambling. The article started with his now renowned dictum \"Philosophy of science without history of science is empty; history of science without philosophy of science is blind\".\nHowever, neither Lakatos himself nor his collaborators ever completed the first part of this dictum by showing that in any scientific revolution the great majority of the relevant scientific community converted just when Lakatos's criterion \u2013 one programme successfully predicting some novel facts whilst its competitor degenerated \u2013 was satisfied. Indeed, for the historical case studies in his 1968 article \"Criticism and the Methodology of Scientific Research Programmes\" he had openly admitted as much, commenting: \"In this paper it is not my purpose to go on seriously to the second stage of comparing rational reconstructions with actual history for any lack of historicity.\"\n", "## Criticism\n\n### Feyerabend\nPaul Feyerabend argued that Lakatos's methodology was not a methodology at all, but merely \"words that sound like the elements of a methodology\". He argued that Lakatos's methodology was no different in practice from epistemological anarchism, Feyerabend's own position. He wrote in Science in a Free Society (after Lakatos's death) that:\n    \n    Lakatos realized and admitted that the existing standards of rationality, standards of logic included, were too restrictive and would have hindered science had they been applied with determination. He therefore permitted the scientist to violate them (he admits that science is not \"rational\" in the sense of these standards). However, he demanded that research programmes show certain features in the long run \u2014 they must be progressive... I have argued that this demand no longer restricts scientific practice. Any development agrees with it.\n    \n\nLakatos and Feyerabend planned to produce a joint work in which Lakatos would develop a rationalist description of science, and Feyerabend would attack it. The correspondence between Lakatos and Feyerabend, where the two discussed the project, has since been reproduced, with commentary, by Matteo Motterlini.\n"]}
